     Hartford for his Christmas vacation, the Warner and Clemens families
     had joined in preparing for him a surprise performance of The Prince
     and the Pauper.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Clemens household was always given to
     theatricals, and it was about this time that scenery and a stage
     were prepared--mainly by the sculptor Gerhardt--for these home
     performances, after which productions of The Prince and the Pauper
     were given with considerable regularity to audiences consisting of
     parents and invited friends.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The subject is a fascinating one, but

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">MY DEAR HOWELLS,--The date set for the Prince and Pauper play is ten

here during the day; the one that leaves Boston toward the end of the
afternoon would be a trifle late; the performance would have already
begun when you reached the house.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I'm out of the woods.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the last day of the year I had paid out
$182,000 on the Grant book and it was totally free from debt.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mark Twain's mother was a woman of sturdy character and with a keen
     sense of humor and tender sympathies.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her husband, John Marshall
     Clemens, had been a man of high moral character, honored by all who
     knew him, respected and apparently loved by his wife.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No one would
     ever have supposed that during all her years of marriage, and almost
     to her death, she carried a secret romance that would only be told
     at last in the weary disappointment of old age.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is a curious
     story, and it came to light in this curious way:


                       To W. D. Howells, in Boston:

                                        HARTFORD, May 19, '86.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">MY DEAR HOWELLS,--..... Here's a secret.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A most curious and pathetic
romance, which has just come to light.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Read these things, but don't
mention them.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Last fall, my old mother--then 82--took a notion to attend
a convention of old settlers of the Mississippi Valley in an Iowa town.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My brother's wife was astonished; and represented to her the hardships
and fatigues of such a trip, and said my mother might possibly not even
survive them; and said there could be no possible interest for her in
such a meeting and such a crowd.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But my mother insisted, and persisted;
and finally gained her point.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They started; and all the way my mother
was young again with excitement, interest, eagerness, anticipation.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They
reached the town and the hotel.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My mother strode with the same eagerness
in her eye and her step, to the counter, and said:

"Is Dr. Barrett of St. Louis, here?"</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"No.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was here, but he returned to St. Louis this morning."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"Will he come again?"</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"No."

My mother turned away, the fire all gone from her, and said, "Let us go
home."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They went straight back to Keokuk.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My mother sat silent and thinking for
many days--a thing which had never happened before.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then one day she
said:

"I will tell you a secret.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When I was eighteen, a young medical student
named Barrett lived in Columbia (Ky.) eighteen miles away; and he used to
ride over to see me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This continued for some time.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I loved him with my
whole heart, and I knew that he felt the same toward me, though no words
had been spoken.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was too bashful to speak--he could not do it.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Everybody supposed we were engaged--took it for granted we were--but we
were not.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By and by there was to be a party in a neighboring town, and
he wrote my uncle telling him his feelings, and asking him to drive me
over in his buggy and let him (Barrett) drive me back, so that he might
have that opportunity to propose.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My uncle should have done as he was
asked, without explaining anything to me; but instead, he read me the
letter; and then, of course, I could not go--and did not.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He (Barrett)
left the country presently, and I, to stop the clacking tongues, and to
show him that I did not care, married, in a pet.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In all these sixty-four
years I have not seen him since.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I saw in a paper that he was going to
attend that Old Settlers' Convention.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Only three hours before we reached
that hotel, he had been standing there!"</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since then, her memory is wholly faded out and gone; and now she writes
letters to the school-mates who had been dead forty years, and wonders
why they neglect her and do not answer.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Think of her carrying that pathetic burden in her old heart sixty-four
years, and no human being ever suspecting it!</MPQASENT>
                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yrs ever,
                                        MARK.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We do not get the idea from this letter that those two long ago
sweethearts quarreled, but Mark Twain once spoke of their having done so,
and there may have been a disagreement, assuming that there was a
subsequent meeting.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It does not matter, now.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In speaking of it, Mark
Twain once said: "It is as pathetic a romance as any that has crossed the
field of my personal experience in a long lifetime."<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">--[When Mark Twain:
A Biography was written this letter had not come to light, and the matter
was stated there in accordance with Mark Twain's latest memory of it.]</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Howells wrote: "After all, how poor and hackneyed all the inventions are
compared with the simple and stately facts.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Who could have imagined such
a heart-break as that?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet it went along with the fulfillment of
everyday duty and made no more noise than a grave under foot.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I doubt if
fiction will ever get the knack of such things."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jane Clemens now lived with her son Orion and his wife, in Keokuk, where
she was more contented than elsewhere.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In these later days her memory
had become erratic, her realization of events about her uncertain, but
there were times when she was quite her former self, remembering clearly
and talking with her old-time gaiety of spirit.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mark Twain frequently
sent her playful letters to amuse her, letters full of such boyish gaiety
as had amused her long years before.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The one that follows is a fair
example.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was written after a visit which Clemens and his family had
paid to Keokuk.</MPQASENT>


                       <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Jane Clemens, in Keokuk:

                                             ELMIRA, Aug. 7, '86.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DEAR MA,--I heard that Molly and Orion and Pamela had been sick, but I
see by your letter that they are much better now, or nearly well.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When
we visited you a month ago, it seemed to us that your Keokuk weather was
pretty hot; Jean and Clara sat up in bed at Mrs. McElroy's and cried
about it, and so did I; but I judge by your letter that it has cooled
down, now, so that a person is comparatively comfortable, with his skin
off.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Well it did need cooling; I remember that I burnt a hole in my
shirt, there, with some ice cream that fell on it; and Miss Jenkins told
me they never used a stove, but cooked their meals on a marble-topped
table in the drawing-room, just with the natural heat.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If anybody else
had told me, I would not have believed it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I was told by the Bishop of
Keokuk that he did not allow crying at funerals, because it scalded the
furniture.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If Miss Jenkins had told me that, I would have believed it.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This reminds me that you speak of Dr. Jenkins and his family as if they
were strangers to me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Indeed they are not.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Don't you suppose I remember
gratefully how tender the doctor was with Jean when she hurt her arm, and
how quickly he got the pain out of the hurt, whereas I supposed it was
going to last at least an hour?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No, I don't forget some things as easily
as I do others.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yes, it was pretty hot weather.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now here, when a person is going to die,
he is always in a sweat about where he is going to; but in Keokuk of
course they don't care, because they are fixed for everything.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It has
set me reflecting, it has taught me a lesson.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By and by, when my health
fails, I am going to put all my affairs in order, and bid good-bye to my
friends here, and kill all the people I don't like, and go out to Keokuk
and prepare for death.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They are all well in this family, and we all send love.</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Affly Your Son

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The ways of city officials and corporations are often past
     understanding, and Mark Twain sometimes found it necessary to write
     picturesque letters of protest.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The following to a Hartford
     lighting company is a fair example of these documents.</MPQASENT>


           <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To a gas and electric-lighting company, in Hartford:

GENTLEMEN,--There are but two places in our whole street where lights
could be of any value, by any accident, and you have measured and
appointed your intervals so ingeniously as to leave each of those places
in the centre of a couple of hundred yards of solid darkness.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I
noticed that you were setting one of your lights in such a way that I
could almost see how to get into my gate at night, I suspected that it
was a piece of carelessness on the part of the workmen, and would be
corrected as soon as you should go around inspecting and find it out.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My judgment was right; it is always right, when you axe concerned.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For
fifteen years, in spite of my prayers and tears, you persistently kept a
gas lamp exactly half way between my gates, so that I couldn't find
either of them after dark; and then furnished such execrable gas that I
had to hang a danger signal on the lamp post to keep teams from running
into it, nights.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now I suppose your present idea is, to leave us a
little more in the dark.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Don't mind us--out our way; we possess but one vote apiece, and no rights
which you are in any way bound to respect.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Please take your electric
light and go to--but never mind, it is not for me to suggest; you will
probably find the way; and any way you can reasonably count on divine
assistance if you lose your bearings.</MPQASENT>

                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">S. L. CLEMENS.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">[Etext Editor's Note: Twain wrote another note to Hartford Gas and
     Electric, which he may not have mailed and which Paine does not
     include in these volumes:
     "Gentleman:--Someday you are going to move me almost to the point
     of irritation with your God-damned chuckle headed fashion of
     turning off your God-damned gas without giving notice to your
     God-damned parishioners--and you did it again last night--"
     D.W.]

     Frequently Clemens did not send letters of this sort after they were
     written.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Sometimes he realized the uselessness of such protest,
     sometimes the mere writing of them had furnished the necessary
     relief, and he put, the letter away, or into the wastebasket, and
     wrote something more temperate, or nothing at all.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A few such
     letters here follow.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clemens was all the time receiving application from people who
     wished him to recommend one article or another; books, plays,
     tobacco, and what not.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They were generally persistent people,
     unable to accept a polite or kindly denial.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once he set down some
     remarks on this particular phase of correspondence.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He wrote:


I

No doubt Mr. Edison has been offered a large interest in many and many an
electrical project, for the use of his name to float it withal.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And no
doubt all men who have achieved for their names, in any line of activity
whatever, a sure market value, have been familiar with this sort of
solicitation.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Reputation is a hall-mark: it can remove doubt from pure
silver, and it can also make the plated article pass for pure.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And so, people without a hall-mark of their own are always trying to get
the loan of somebody else's.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a rule, that kind of a person sees only one side of the case.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He sees
that his invention or his painting or his book is--apparently--a trifle
better than you yourself can do, therefore why shouldn't you be willing
to put your hall-mark on it?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">You will be giving the purchaser his full
money's worth; so who is hurt, and where is the harm?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides, are you
not helping a struggling fellow-craftsman, and is it not your duty to do
that?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That side is plenty clear enough to him, but he can't and won't see the
other side, to-wit: that you are a rascal if you put your hall-mark upon
a thing which you did not produce yourself, howsoever good it may be.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How simple that is; and yet there are not two applicants in a hundred who
can, be made to see it.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When one receives an application of this sort, his first emotion is an
indignant sense of insult; his first deed is the penning of a sharp
answer.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He blames nobody but that other person.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That person is a very
base being; he must be; he would degrade himself for money, otherwise it
would not occur to him that you would do such a thing.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But all the same,
that application has done its work, and taken you down in your own
estimation.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You recognize that everybody hasn't as high an opinion of
you as you have of yourself; and in spite of you there ensues an interval
during which you are not, in your own estimation as fine a bird as you
were before.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, being old and experienced, you do not mail your sharp letter,
but leave it lying a day.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That saves you.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">For by that time you have
begun to reflect that you are a person who deals in exaggerations--and
exaggerations are lies.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You meant yours to be playful, and thought you
made them unmistakably so.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But you couldn't make them playfulnesses to a
man who has no sense of the playful and can see nothing but the serious
side of things.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You rattle on quite playfully, and with measureless
extravagance, about how you wept at the tomb of Adam; and all in good
time you find to your astonishment that no end of people took you at your
word and believed you.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And presently they find out that you were not in
earnest.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They have been deceived; therefore, (as they argue--and there
is a sort of argument in it,) you are a deceiver.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you will deceive in
one way, why shouldn't you in another?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So they apply for the use of your
trade-mark.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You are amazed and affronted.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You retort that you are not
that kind of person.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then they are amazed and affronted; and wonder
"since when?"</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By this time you have got your bearings.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You realize that perhaps there
is a little blame on both sides.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You are in the right frame, now.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So
you write a letter void of offense, declining.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You mail this one; you
pigeon-hole the other.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is, being old and experienced, you do, but early in your career, you
don't: you mail the first one.</MPQASENT>


<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">II

An enthusiast who had a new system of musical notation, wrote to me and
suggested that a magazine article from me, contrasting the absurdities of
the old system with the simplicities of his new one, would be sure to
make a "rousing hit."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He shouted and shouted over the marvels wrought by
his system, and quoted the handsome compliments which had been paid it by
famous musical people; but he forgot to tell me what his notation was
like, or what its simplicities consisted in.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So I could not have written
the article if I had wanted to--which I didn't; because I hate strangers
with axes to grind.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I wrote him a courteous note explaining how busy I
was--I always explain how busy I am--and casually drooped this remark:

"I judge the X-X notation to be a rational mode of representing music, in
place of the prevailing fashion, which was the invention of an idiot."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Next mail he asked permission to print that meaningless remark.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I answered, no--courteously, but still, no; explaining that I could not
afford to be placed in the attitude of trying to influence people with a
mere worthless guess.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What a scorcher I got, next mail!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such irony!</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">such sarcasm, such caustic praise of my superhonorable loyalty to the
public!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And withal, such compassion for my stupidity, too, in not being
able to understand my own language.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I cannot remember the words of this
letter broadside, but there was about a page used up in turning this idea
round and round and exposing it in different lights.</MPQASENT>

DEAR SIR,--What is the trouble with you?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If it is your viscera, you
cannot have them taken out and reorganized a moment too soon.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I mean,
if they are inside.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But if you are composed of them, that is another
matter.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is it your brain?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But it could not be your brain.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Possibly it
is your skull: you want to look out for that.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some people, when they get
an idea, it pries the structure apart.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Your system of notation has got
in there, and couldn't find room, without a doubt that is what the

DEAR SIR,--Come, come--take a walk; you disturb the children.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">There was a day, now happily nearly over, when certain newspapers made a
practice of inviting men distinguished in any walk of life to give their
time and effort without charge to express themselves on some subject of
the day, or perhaps they were asked to send their favorite passages in
prose or verse, with the reasons why.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Such symposiums were "features"
that cost the newspapers only the writing of a number of letters,
stationery, and postage.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To one such invitation Mark Twain wrote two
replies.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They follow herewith:

                             Unmailed Answer:

DEAR SIR,--I have received your proposition--which you have imitated from
a pauper London periodical which had previously imitated the idea of this
sort of mendicancy from seventh-rate American journalism, where it
originated as a variation of the inexpensive "interview."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why do you buy Associated Press dispatches?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To make your paper the more
salable, you answer.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But why don't you try to beg them?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why do you
discriminate?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I can sell my stuff; why should I give it to you?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Why
don't you ask me for a shirt?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What is the difference between asking me
for the worth of a shirt and asking me for the shirt itself?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps you
didn't know you were begging.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I would not use that argument--it makes
the user a fool.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The passage of poetry--or prose, if you will--which has
taken deepest root in my thought, and which I oftenest return to and
dwell upon with keenest no matter what, is this:  That the proper place
for journalists who solicit literary charity is on the street corner with
their hats in their hands.</MPQASENT>


                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mailed Answer:

DEAR SIR,--Your favor of recent date is received, but I am obliged by
press of work to decline.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The manager of a traveling theatrical company wrote that he had
     taken the liberty of dramatizing Tom Sawyer, and would like also the
     use of the author's name--the idea being to convey to the public
     that it was a Mark Twain play.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In return for this slight favor the
     manager sent an invitation for Mark Twain to come and see the play--
     to be present on the opening night, as it were, at his (the
     manager's) expense.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He added that if the play should be a go in the
     cities there might be some "arrangement" of profits.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Apparently
     these inducements did not appeal to Mark Twain.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The long unmailed
     reply is the more interesting, but probably the briefer one that
     follows it was quite as effective.</MPQASENT>

                                             HARTFORD, Sept. 8, '87.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">DEAR SIR,--And so it has got around to you, at last; and you also have
"taken the liberty."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You are No. 1365.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When 1364 sweeter and better
people, including the author, have "tried" to dramatize Tom Sawyer and
did not arrive, what sort of show do you suppose you stand?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That is a
book, dear sir, which cannot be dramatized.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One might as well try to
dramatize any other hymn.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tom Sawyer is simply a hymn, put into prose
form to give it a worldly air.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Why the pale doubt that flitteth dim and nebulous athwart the forecastle
of your third sentence?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Have no fears.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Your piece will be a Go.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It will go out the back door on the first night.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They've all done it
--the 1364.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So will 1365.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not one of us ever thought of the simple
device of half-soling himself with a stove-lid.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ah, what suffering a
little hindsight would have saved us.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Treasure this hint.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How kind of you to invite me to the funeral.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Go to; I have attended a
thousand of them.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have seen Tom Sawyer's remains in all the different
kinds of dramatic shrouds there are.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You cannot start anything fresh.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Are you serious when you propose to pay my expence--if that is the
Susquehannian way of spelling it?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And can you be aware that I charge a
hundred dollars a mile when I travel for pleasure?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Do you realize that
it is 432 miles to Susquehanna?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Would it be handy for you to send me the
$43,200 first, so I could be counting it as I come along; because
railroading is pretty dreary to a sensitive nature when there's nothing
sordid to buck at for Zeitvertreib.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Now as I understand it, dear and magnanimous 1365, you are going to
recreate Tom Sawyer dramatically, and then do me the compliment to put me
in the bills as father of this shady offspring.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sir, do you know that
this kind of a compliment has destroyed people before now?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Listen.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Twenty-four years ago, I was strangely handsome.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The remains of it are
still visible through the rifts of time.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I was so handsome that human
activities ceased as if spellbound when I came in view, and even
inanimate things stopped to look--like locomotives, and district
messenger boys and so-on.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In San Francisco, in the rainy season I was
often mistaken for fair weather.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Upon one occasion I was traveling in
the Sonora region, and stopped for an hour's nooning, to rest my horse
and myself.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">All the town came out to look.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The tribes of Indians
gathered to look.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A Piute squaw named her baby for me,--a voluntary
compliment which pleased me greatly.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other attentions were paid me.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Last of all arrived the president and faculty of Sonora University and
offered me the post of Professor of Moral Culture and the Dogmatic
Humanities; which I accepted gratefully, and entered at once upon my
duties.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But my name had pleased the Indians, and in the deadly kindness
of their hearts they went on naming their babies after me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I tried to
stop it, but the Indians could not understand why I should object to so
manifest a compliment.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The thing grew and grew and spread and spread and
became exceedingly embarrassing.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The University stood it a couple of
years; but then for the sake of the college they felt obliged to call a
halt, although I had the sympathy of the whole faculty.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The president
himself said to me, "I am as sorry as I can be for you, and would still
hold out if there were any hope ahead; but you see how it is: there are a
hundred and thirty-two of them already, and fourteen precincts to hear
from.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The circumstance has brought your name into most wide and
unfortunate renown.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It causes much comment--I believe that that is not
an over-statement.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some of this comment is palliative, but some of it
--by patrons at a distance, who only know the statistics without the
explanation,--is offensive, and in some cases even violent.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nine
students have been called home.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The trustees of the college have been
growing more and more uneasy all these last months--steadily along with
the implacable increase in your census--and I will not conceal from you
that more than once they have touched upon the expediency of a change in
the Professorship of Moral Culture.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The coarsely sarcastic editorial in
yesterday's Alta, headed Give the Moral Acrobat a Rest--has brought
things to a crisis, and I am charged with the unpleasant duty of
receiving your resignation."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I know you only mean me a kindness, dear 1365, but it is a most deadly
mistake.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Please do not name your Injun for me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Truly Yours.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before the days of international copyright no American author's
     books were pirated more freely by Canadian publishers than those of

     cheaply printed, found their way into the United States, and were
     sold in competition with his better editions.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The law on the

          <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Unmailed Letter to H. C. Christiancy, on book Piracy:

                                             HARTFORD, Dec. 18, '87.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">H. C. CHRISTIANCY, ESQ.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">DEAR SIR,--As I understand it, the position of the U. S. Government is
this: If a person be captured on the border with counterfeit bonds in his
hands--bonds of the N. Y. Central Railway, for instance--the procedure in
his case shall be as follows:

1.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If the N. Y. C. have not previously filed in the several police
offices along the border, proof of ownership of the originals of the
bonds, the government officials must collect a duty on the counterfeits,
and then let them go ahead and circulate in this country.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">2.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But if there is proof already on file, then the N. Y. C.  may pay the
duty and take the counterfeits.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But in no case will the United States consent to go without its share of
the swag.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is delicious.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The biggest and proudest government on earth
turned sneak-thief; collecting pennies on stolen property, and pocketing
them with a greasy and libidinous leer; going into partnership with
foreign thieves to rob its own children; and when the child escapes the
foreigner, descending to the abysmal baseness of hanging on and robbing
the infant all alone by itself!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dear sir, this is not any more
respectable than for a father to collect toll on the forced prostitution
of his own daughter; in fact it is the same thing.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Upon these terms,
what is a U. S. custom house but a "fence?"</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That is all it is: a
legalized trader in stolen goods.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And this nasty law, this filthy law, this unspeakable law calls itself a
"regulation for the protection of owners of copyright!"</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Can sarcasm go
further than that?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In what way does it protect them?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Inspiration itself
could not furnish a rational answer to that question.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whom does it
protect, then?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nobody, as far as I can see, but the foreign thief-
sometimes--and his fellow-footpad the U. S. government, all the time.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What could the Central Company do with the counterfeit bonds after it had
bought them of the star spangled banner Master-thief?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sell them at a
dollar apiece and fetch down the market for the genuine hundred-dollar
bond?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What could I do with that 20-cent copy of "Roughing It" which the
United States has collared on the border and is waiting to release to me
for cash in case I am willing to come down to its moral level and help
rob myself?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sell it at ten or fifteen cents--duty added--and destroy the
market for the original $3,50 book?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who ever did invent that law?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I
would like to know the name of that immortal jackass.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dear sir, I appreciate your courtesy in stretching your authority in the
desire to do me a kindness, and I sincerely thank you for it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But I have
no use for that book; and if I were even starving for it I would not pay
duty on in either to get it or suppress it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No doubt there are ways in
which I might consent to go into partnership with thieves and fences,
but this is not one of them.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This one revolts the remains of my self-
respect; turns my stomach.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I think I could companion with a highwayman
who carried a shot-gun and took many risks; yes, I think I should like
that if I were younger; but to go in with a big rich government that robs
paupers, and the widows and orphans of paupers and takes no risk--why the
thought just gags me.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Oh, no, I shall never pay any duties on pirated books of mine.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am much
too respectable for that--yet awhile.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But here--one thing that grovels
me is this: as far as I can discover--while freely granting that the
U. S. copyright laws are far and away the most idiotic that exist
anywhere on the face of the earth--they don't authorize the government to
admit pirated books into this country, toll or no toll.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And so I think
that that regulation is the invention of one of those people--as a rule,
early stricken of God, intellectually--the departmental interpreters of
the laws, in Washington.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They can always be depended on to take any
reasonably good law and interpret the common sense all out of it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They
can be depended on, every time, to defeat a good law, and make it
inoperative--yes, and utterly grotesque, too, mere matter for laughter
and derision.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Take some of the decisions of the Post-office Department,
for instance--though I do not mean to suggest that that asylum is any
worse than the others for the breeding and nourishing of incredible
lunatics--I merely instance it because it happens to be the first to come
into my mind.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Take that case of a few years ago where the P. M. General
suddenly issued an edict requiring you to add the name of the State after
Boston, New York, Chicago, &c, in your superscriptions, on pain of having
your letter stopped and forwarded to the dead-letter office; yes, and I
believe he required the county, too.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He made one little concession in
favor of New York: you could say "New York City," and stop there; but if
you left off the "city," you must add "N. Y."  to your "New York."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why,
it threw the business of the whole country into chaos and brought
commerce almost to a stand-still.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now think of that!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When that man goes
to--to--well, wherever he is going to--we shan't want the microscopic
details of his address.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I guess we can find him.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Well</MPQAPOL>, as I was saying, I <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">believe</MPQAPOL> that this whole <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">paltry</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">ridiculous</MPQAPOL>
swindle is a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">pure</MPQAPOL> creation of one of those cabbages that used to be at
the head of one of those <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Retreats</MPQAPOL> down there--Departments, you <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">know</MPQAPOL>--and
that you will find it <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL>, if you will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">look</MPQAPOL> into it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">moreover</MPQAPOL>--but
land, I reckon we are both <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">tired</MPQAPOL> by this time.</MPQASENT>
