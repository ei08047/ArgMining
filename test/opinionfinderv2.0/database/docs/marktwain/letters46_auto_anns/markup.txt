     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The author, J. Howard Moore, sent a copy of his book, The Universal
     Kinship, with a letter in which he said: "Most humorists have no
     anxiety except to glorify themselves and add substance to their
     pocket-books by making their readers laugh.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You have shown, on many
     occasions, that your mission is not simply to antidote the
     melancholy of a world, but includes a real and intelligent concern
     for the general welfare of your fellowman."</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Universal Kinship was the kind of a book that Mark Twain
     appreciated, as his acknowledgment clearly shows.</MPQASENT>


                         <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Mr. J. Howard Moore:

                                                       Feb. 2, '07.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">DEAR MR. MOORE, The book has furnished me several days of deep pleasure
and satisfaction; it has compelled my gratitude at the same time, since
it saves me the labor of stating my own long-cherished opinions and
reflections and resentments by doing it lucidly and fervently and
irascibly for me.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is one thing that always puzzles me: as inheritors of the mentality
of our reptile ancestors we have improved the inheritance by a thousand
grades; but in the matter of the morals which they left us we have gone
backward as many grades.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That evolution is strange, and to me
unaccountable and unnatural.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Necessarily we started equipped with their
perfect and blemishless morals; now we are wholly destitute; we have no
real, morals, but only artificial ones--morals created and preserved by
the forced suppression of natural and hellish instincts.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet we are dull
enough to be vain of them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Certainly we are a sufficiently comical
invention, we humans.</MPQASENT>
                         <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sincerely Yours,
                                   S. L. CLEMENS.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Mark Twain's own books were always being excommunicated by some
     librarian, and the matter never failed to invite the attention and
     amusement of the press, and the indignation of many correspondents.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Usually the books were Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, the morals of which
     were not regarded as wholly exemplary.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But in 1907 a small library,
     in a very small town, attained a day's national notoriety by putting
     the ban on Eve's Diary, not so much on account of its text as for
     the chaste and exquisite illustrations by Lester Ralph.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the
     reporters came in a troop to learn about it, the author said: "I
     believe this time the trouble is mainly with the pictures.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I did
     not draw them.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I wish I had--they are so beautiful."</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just at this time, Dr. William Lyon Phelps, of Yale, was giving a
     literary talk to the Teachers' Club, of Hartford, dwelling on the
     superlative value of Mark Twain's writings for readers old and
     young.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. F. G. Whitmore, an old Hartford friend, wrote Clemens
     of the things that Phelps had said, as consolation for Eve's latest
     banishment.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This gave him a chance to add something to what he had
     said to the reporters.</MPQASENT>


                      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Whitmore, in Hartford:

                                                       Feb. 7, 1907.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">DEAR MRS. WHITMORE,--But the truth is, that when a Library expels a book
of mine and leaves an unexpurgated Bible lying around where unprotected
youth and age can get hold of it, the deep unconscious irony of it
delights me and doesn't anger me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But even if it angered me such words
as those of Professor Phelps would take the sting all out.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nobody
attaches weight to the freaks of the Charlton Library, but when a man
like Phelps speaks, the world gives attention.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some day I hope to meet
him and thank him for his courage for saying those things out in public.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Custom is, to think a handsome thing in private but tame it down in the
utterance.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I hope you are all well and happy; and thereto I add my love.</MPQASENT>
                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sincerely yours,
                                        S. L. CLEMENS.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In May, 1907, Mark Twain was invited to England to receive from
     Oxford the degree of Literary Doctor.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was an honor that came to
     him as a sort of laurel crown at the end of a great career, and
     gratified him exceedingly.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To Moberly Bell, of the London Times,
     he expressed his appreciation.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bell had been over in April and
     Clemens believed him concerned in the matter.</MPQASENT>


                       <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Moberly Bell, in London:

                                        21 FIFTH AVENUE, May 3, '07
DEAR MR. BELL,--Your hand is in it!</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">and you have my best thanks.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although I wouldn't cross an ocean again for the price of the ship that
carried me, I am glad to do it for an Oxford degree.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I shall plan to
sail for England a shade before the middle of June, so that I can have a
few days in London before the 26th.</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sincerely,

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had taken a house at Tuxedo for the summer, desiring to be near
     New York City, and in the next letter he writes Mr. Rogers
     concerning his London plans.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We discover, also, in this letter that
     he has begun work on the Redding home and the cost is to come
     entirely out of the autobiographical chapters then running in the
     North American Review.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It may be of passing interest to note here
     that he had the usual house-builder's fortune.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He received thirty
     thousand dollars for the chapters; the house cost him nearly double
     that amount.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">DEAR ADMIRAL,--Why hang it, I am not going to see you and Mrs. Rogers at
all in England!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is a great disappointment.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I leave there a month
from now--June 29.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No, I shall see you; for by your itinerary you are
most likely to come to London June 21st or along there.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So that is very
good and satisfactory.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have declined all engagements but two--Whitelaw
Reid (dinner) June 21, and the Pilgrims (lunch), June 25.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Oxford
ceremony is June 26.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have paid my return passage in the Minne-

week or two longer--I can't tell, yet.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I do very much want to meet up
with the boys for the last time.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have signed the contract for the building of the house on my
Connecticut farm and specified the cost limit, and work has been begun.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The cost has to all come out of a year's instalments of Autobiography in
the N. A. Review.</MPQASENT>

strides.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By all accounts she is singing like a bird, and is not afraid

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tuxedo is a charming place; I think it hasn't its equal anywhere.</MPQASENT>

     The story of Mark Twain's extraordinary reception and triumph in
     England has been told.<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">--[Mark Twain; A Biography, chaps.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">cclvi-
     cclix]--It was, in fact, the crowning glory of his career.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps
     one of the most satisfactory incidents of his sojourn was a dinner
     given to him by the staff of Punch, in the historic offices at 10
     Bouverie Street where no other foreign visitor had been thus
     honored--a notable distinction.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When the dinner ended, little joy
     Agnew, daughter of the chief editor, entered and presented to the
     chief guest the original drawing of a cartoon by Bernard Partridge,
     which had appeared on the front page of Punch.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In this picture the
     presiding genius of the paper is offering to Mark Twain health, long
     life, and happiness from "The Punch Bowl."</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A short time after his return to America he received a pretty
     childish letter from little Miss Agnew acknowledging a photograph he
     had sent her, and giving a list of her pets and occupations.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Such a
     letter always delighted Mark Twain, and his pleasure in this one is
     reflected in his reply.</MPQASENT>


                      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Miss Joy Agnew, in London:

                                                  TUXEDO PARK, NEW YORK.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Unto you greetings and salutation and worship, you dear, sweet little
rightly-named Joy!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I can see you now almost as vividly as I saw you that
night when you sat flashing and beaming upon those sombre swallow-tails.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">"Fair as a star when only one
     Is shining in the sky."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oh, you were indeed the only one--there wasn't even the remotest chance
of competition with you, dear!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ah, you are a decoration, you little
witch!</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The idea of your house going to the wanton expense of a flower garden!<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">--
aren't you enough?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And what do you want to go and discourage the other
flowers for?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Is that the right spirit?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">is it considerate?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">is it kind?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">How do you suppose they feel when you come around--looking the way you
look?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And you so pink and sweet and dainty and lovely and supernatural?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Why, it makes them feel embarrassed and artificial, of course; and in my
opinion it is just as pathetic as it can be.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now then you want to
reform--dear--and do right.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Well certainly you are well off, Joy:

3 bantams;
3 goldfish;
3 doves;
6 canaries;
2 dogs;
1 cat;

All you need, now, to be permanently beyond the reach of want, is one
more dog--just one more good, gentle, high principled, affectionate,
loyal dog who wouldn't want any nobler service than the golden privilege
of lying at your door, nights, and biting everything that came along--and
I am that very one, and ready to come at the dropping of a hat.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Do you think you could convey my love and thanks to your "daddy" and Owen
Seaman and those other oppressed and down-trodden subjects of yours, you
darling small tyrant?</MPQASENT>

     Elinor Glyn, author of Three Weeks and other erotic tales, was in
     America that winter and asked permission to call on Mark Twain.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An
     appointment was made and Clemens discussed with her, for an hour or
     more, those crucial phases of life which have made living a complex
     problem since the days of Eve in Eden.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mrs. Glyn had never before
     heard anything like Mark Twain's wonderful talk, and she was anxious
     to print their interview.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She wrote what she could remember of it
     and sent it to him for approval.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If his conversation had been
     frank, his refusal was hardly less so.</MPQASENT>


                    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Elinor Glyn, in New York:

                                                       Jan. 22, '08.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DEAR MRS. GLYN, It reads pretty poorly--I get the sense of it, but it is
a poor literary job; however, it would have to be that because nobody can
be reported even approximately, except by a stenographer.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Approximations, synopsized speeches, translated poems, artificial flowers
and chromos all have a sort of value, but it is small.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you had put
upon paper what I really said it would have wrecked your type-machine.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I said some fetid, over-vigorous things, but that was because it was a
confidential conversation.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I said nothing for print.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My own report of
the same conversation reads like Satan roasting a Sunday school.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It, and
certain other readable chapters of my autobiography will not be published
until all the Clemens family are dead--dead and correspondingly
indifferent.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were written to entertain me, not the rest of the
world.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am not here to do good--at least not to do it intentionally.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You must pardon me for dictating this letter; I am sick a-bed and not
feeling as well as I might.</MPQASENT>
                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sincerely Yours,

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Among the cultured men of England Mark Twain had no greater admirer,
     or warmer friend, than Andrew Lang.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They were at one on most
     literary subjects, and especially so in their admiration of the life
     and character of Joan of Arc.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Both had written of her, and both
     held her to be something almost more than mortal.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When, therefore,
     Anatole France published his exhaustive biography of the maid of
     Domremy, a book in which he followed, with exaggerated minuteness
     and innumerable footnotes, every step of Joan's physical career at
     the expense of her spiritual life, which he was inclined to cheapen,
     Lang wrote feelingly, and with some contempt, of the performance,
     inviting the author of the Personal Recollections to come to the
     rescue of their heroine.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">"Compare every one of his statements with
     the passages he cites from authorities, and make him the laughter of
     the world" he wrote.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">"If you are lazy about comparing I can make
     you a complete set of what the authorities say, and of what this
     amazing novelist says that they say.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I tell you that he thinks
     the Epiphany (January 6, Twelfth Night) is December 25th--Christmas
     Day-you begin to see what an egregious ass he is.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Treat him like
     Dowden, and oblige"--a reference to Mark Twain's defense of Harriet
     Shelley, in which he had heaped ridicule on Dowden's Life of the
     Poet--a masterly performance; one of the best that ever came from
     Mark Twain's pen.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lang's suggestion would seem to have been a welcome one.</MPQASENT>


                        <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Andrew Lang, in London:

                                        NEW YORK, April 25, 1908.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DEAR MR. LANG,--I haven't seen the book nor any review of it, but only
not very-understandable references to it--of a sort which discomforted
me, but of course set my interest on fire.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I don't want to have to read
it in French--I should lose the nice shades, and should do a lot of gross
misinterpreting, too.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there'll be a translation soon, nicht wahr?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I will wait for it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I note with joy that you say: "If you are lazy about
comparing, (which I most certainly am), I can make you a complete set of
what the authorities say, and of what this amazing novelist says that
they say."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ah, do it for me!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then I will attempt the article, and (if I succeed in
doing it to my satisfaction,) will publish it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is long since I
touched a pen (3 1/2 years), and I was intending to continue this happy
holiday to the gallows, but--there are things that could beguile me to
break this blessed Sabbath.</MPQASENT>
                    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yours very sincerely,
                                   S. L. CLEMENS.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Certainly it is an interesting fact that an Englishman--one of the
     race that burned Joan--should feel moved to defend her memory
     against the top-heavy perversions of a distinguished French author.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But Lang seems never to have sent the notes.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The copying would have
     been a tremendous task, and perhaps he never found the time for it.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We may regret to-day that he did not, for Mark Twain's article on
     the French author's Joan would have been at least unique.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Samuel Clemens could never accustom himself to the loss of his wife.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From the time of her death, marriage-which had brought him his
     greatest joy in life-presented itself to him always with the thought
     of bereavement, waiting somewhere just behind.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The news of an
     approaching wedding saddened him and there was nearly always a
     somber tinge in his congratulations, of which the following to a
     dear friend is an example:


                   To Father Fitz-Simon, in Washington:

                                                  June 5, '08.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">DEAR FATHER FITZ-SIMON,--Marriage--yes, it is the supreme felicity of
life, I concede it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And it is also the supreme tragedy of life.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The
deeper the love the surer the tragedy.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And the more disconsolating when
it comes.</MPQASENT>

I grieve for you.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not for both of you and not for the one that shall go

marriage I feel too deeply for that, and I have to bleed it all out or
shut it all in.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And so you must consider what I have been through, and
am passing through and be charitable with me.</MPQASENT>

long.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I do not really want to be present; yet for friendship's sake and because

     took no credit for pure invention and allowed none to others.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">DEAR SIR,--You say "I often owe my best sermons to a suggestion received
in reading or from other exterior sources."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Your remark is not quite in
accordance with the facts.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We must change it to--"I owe all my thoughts,
sermons and ideas to suggestions received from sources outside of myself."</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The simplified English of this proposition is--"No man's brains ever
originated an idea."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is an astonishing thing that after all these
ages the world goes on thinking the human brain machinery can originate a
thought.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It can't.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It never has done it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In all cases, little and big, the
thought is born of a suggestion; and in all cases the suggestions come to
the brain from the outside.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The brain never acts except from exterior
impulse.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A man can satisfy himself of the truth of this by a single process,--let
him examine every idea that occurs to him in an hour; a day; in a week
--in a lifetime if he please.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He will always find that an outside
something suggested the thought, something which he saw with his eyes or
heard with his ears or perceived by his touch--not necessarily to-day,
nor yesterday, nor last year, nor twenty years ago, but sometime or
other.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Usually the source of the suggestion is immediately traceable,
but sometimes it isn't.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, if you will examine every thought that occurs to you for the
next two days, you will find that in at least nine cases out of ten you
can put your finger on the outside suggestion--And that ought to convince
you that No. 10 had that source too, although you cannot at present hunt
it down and find it.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The idea of writing to me would have had to wait a long time if it waited
until your brain originated it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was born of an outside suggestion--
Sir Thomas and my old Captain.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The hypnotist thinks he has invented a new thing--suggestion.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is
very sad.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I don't know where my captain got his kerosene idea.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(It was
forty-one years ago, and he is long ago dead.)</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I know that it didn't
originate in his head, but it was born from a suggestion from the
outside.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yesterday a guest said, "How did you come to think of writing 'The Prince
and the Pauper?'"</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I didn't.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The thought came to me from the outside--
suggested by that pleasant and picturesque little history-book, Charlotte
M. Yonge's "Little Duke," I doubt if Mrs. Burnett knows whence came to
her the suggestion to write "Little Lord Fauntleroy," but I know; it came
to her from reading "The Prince and the Pauper."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In all my life I have
never originated an idea, and neither has she, nor anybody else.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Man's mind is a clever machine, and can work up materials into ingenious
fancies and ideas, but it can't create the material; none but the gods

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DEAR MRS. ROGERS, I believe I am the wellest man on the planet to-day,
and good for a trip to Fair Haven (which I discussed with the Captain of
the New Bedford boat, who pleasantly accosted me in the Grand Central
August 5) but the doctor came up from New York day before yesterday, and
gave positive orders that I must not stir from here before frost.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is
because I was threatened with a swoon, 10 or 12 days ago, and went to New
York a day or two later to attend my nephew's funeral and got horribly
exhausted by the heat and came back here and had a bilious collapse.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In
24 hours I was as sound as a nut again, but nobody believes it but me.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is a prodigiously satisfactory place, and I am so glad I don't have
to go back to the turmoil and rush of New York.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The house stands high
and the horizons are wide, yet the seclusion is perfect.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The nearest
public road is half a mile away, so there is nobody to look in, and I
don't have to wear clothes if I don't want to.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have been down stairs
in night-gown and slippers a couple of hours, and have been photographed
in that costume; but I will dress, now, and behave myself.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That doctor had half an idea that there is something the matter with my
brain.  .  .</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Doctors do know so little and they do charge so much for
it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I wish Henry Rogers would come here, and I wish you would come with
him.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You can't rest in that crowded place, but you could rest here, for
sure!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I would learn bridge, and entertain you, and rob you.</MPQASENT>
                         <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With love to you both,
                                        Ever yours,

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">DEAR HOWELLS,--Won't you and Mrs. Howells and Mildred come and give us as
many days as you can spare, and examine John's triumph?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is the most
satisfactory house I am acquainted with, and the most satisfactorily
situated.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But it is no place to work in, because one is outside of it all the time,
while the sun and the moon are on duty.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Outside of it in the loggia,
where the breezes blow and the tall arches divide up the scenery and
frame it.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It's a ghastly long distance to come, and I wouldn't travel such a
distance to see anything short of a memorial museum, but if you can't
come now you can at least come later when you return to New York, for the
journey will be only an hour and a half per express-train.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Things are
gradually and steadily taking shape inside the house, and nature is
taking care of the outside in her ingenious and wonderful fashion--and
she is competent and asks no help and gets none.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have retired from New
York for good, I have retired from labor for good, I have dismissed my
stenographer and have entered upon a holiday whose other end is in the
cemetery.</MPQASENT>
                    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yours ever,

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">DEAR SIR,--By "private," I mean don't print any remarks of mine.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I like your list.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The "largest visible influence."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These terms require you to add Jesus.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And they doubly and trebly require
you to add Satan.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From A.D. 350 to A.D. 1850 these gentlemen exercised a
vaster influence over a fifth part of the human race than was exercised

nine hundredths of this influence proceeded from Satan, the remaining
fraction of it from Jesus.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During those 1500 years the fear of Satan and
Hell made 99 Christians where love of God and Heaven landed one.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">During

as much to the business as was the influence of all the rest of the Holy
Family put together.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You have asked me a question, and I have answered it seriously and
sincerely.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You have put in Buddha--a god, with a following, at one time,
greater than Jesus ever had: a god with perhaps a little better evidence
of his godship than that which is offered for Jesus's.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How then, in

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The "Children's Theatre" of the next letter was an institution of

                       <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Hookway, in Chicago:
                                                  Sept., 1908.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">DEAR MRS. HOOKWAY,--Although I am full of the spirit of work this
morning, a rarity with me lately--I must steal a moment or two for a word
in person: for I have been reading the eloquent account in the Record-
Herald and am pleasurably stirred, to my deepest deeps.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The reading
brings vividly back to me my pet and pride.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Children's Theatre of
the East side, New York.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And it supports and re-affirms what I have so
often and strenuously said in public that a children's theatre is easily
the most valuable adjunct that any educational institution for the young
can have, and that no otherwise good school is complete without it.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is much the most effective teacher of morals and promoter of good
conduct that the ingenuity of man has yet devised, for the reason that
its lessons are not taught wearily by book and by dreary homily, but by
visible and enthusing action; and they go straight to the heart, which is
the rightest of right places for them.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Book morals often get no further
than the intellect, if they even get that far on their spectral and
shadowy pilgrimage: but when they travel from a Children's Theatre they
do not stop permanently at that halfway house, but go on home.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The children's theatre is the only teacher of morals and conduct and high
ideals that never bores the pupil, but always leaves him sorry when the
lesson is over.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And as for history, no other teacher is for a moment
comparable to it: no other can make the dead heroes of the world rise up
and shake the dust of the ages from their bones and live and move and
breathe and speak and be real to the looker and listener: no other can
make the study of the lives and times of the illustrious dead a delight,
a splendid interest, a passion; and no other can paint a history-lesson
in colors that will stay, and stay, and never fade.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is my conviction that the children's theatre is one of the very, very
great inventions of the twentieth century; and that its vast educational
value--now but dimly perceived and but vaguely understood--will presently
come to be recognized.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By the article which I have been reading I find
the same things happening in the Howland School that we have become
familiar with in our Children's Theatre (of which I am President, and
sufficiently vain of the distinction.)</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These things among others;

1.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The educating history-study does not stop with the little players,
but the whole school catches the infection and revels in it.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">2.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And it doesn't even stop there; the children carry it home and infect
the family with it--even the parents and grandparents; and the whole
household fall to studying history, and bygone manners and customs and
costumes with eager interest.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And this interest is carried along to the
studying of costumes in old book-plates; and beyond that to the selecting
of fabrics and the making of clothes.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Hundreds of our children learn,
the plays by listening without book, and by making notes; then the
listener goes home and plays the piece--all the parts!</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">to the family.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And the family are glad and proud; glad to listen to the explanations and
analyses, glad to learn, glad to be lifted to planes above their dreary
workaday lives.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our children's theatre is educating 7,000 children--and
their families.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When we put on a play of Shakespeare they fall to
studying it diligently; so that they may be qualified to enjoy it to the
limit when the piece is staged.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">3.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Your Howland School children do the construction-work, stage-

making, everything and all things indeed--and their orchestra and its
leader are from their own ranks.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The article which I have been reading, says--speaking of the historical
play produced by the pupils of the Howland School--

"The question naturally arises, What has this drama done for those who so
enthusiastically took part?<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">--The touching story has made a year out of
the Past live for the children as could no chronology or bald statement
of historical events; it has cultivated the fancy and given to the
imagination strength and purity; work in composition has ceased to be
drudgery, for when all other themes fall flat a subject dealing with some
aspect of the drama presented never fails to arouse interest and a rapid
pushing of pens over paper."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is entirely true.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The interest is not confined to the drama's
story, it spreads out all around the period of the story, and gives to
all the outlying and unrelated happenings of that period a fascinating
interest--an interest which does not fade out with the years, but remains
always fresh, always inspiring, always welcome.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">History-facts dug by the
job, with sweat and tears out of a dry and spiritless text-book--but
never mind, all who have suffered know what that is.  .  .</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I remain, dear madam,
                                             Sincerely yours,
                                                       S. L. CLEMENS.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mark Twain had a special fondness for cats.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As a boy he always
     owned one and it generally had a seat beside him at the table.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There were cats at Quarry Farm and at Hartford, and in the house at
     Redding there was a gray mother-cat named Tammany, of which he was
     especially fond.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Kittens capering about were his chief delight.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a letter to a Chicago woman he tells how those of Tammany
     assisted at his favorite game.</MPQASENT>


               <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Mabel Larkin Patterson, in Chicago:

                                             REDDING, CONNECTICUT,
                                                       Oct. 2, '08.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DEAR MRS. PATTERSON,--The contents of your letter are very pleasant and
very welcome, and I thank you for them, sincerely.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If I can find a
photograph of my "Tammany" and her kittens, I will enclose it in this.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of them likes to be crammed into a corner-pocket of the billiard
table--which he fits as snugly as does a finger in a glove and then he
watches the game (and obstructs it) by the hour, and spoils many a shot
by putting out his paw and changing the direction of a passing ball.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Whenever a ball is in his arms, or so close to him that it cannot be
played upon without risk of hurting him, the player is privileged to
remove it to anyone of the 3 spots that chances to be vacant.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ah, no, my lecturing days are over for good and all.</MPQASENT>
                                        <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sincerely yours,
                                                  S. L. CLEMENS.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The letter to Howells which follows was written a short time before
     the passage of the copyright extension bill, which rendered Mark
     Twain's new plan, here mentioned, unneeded--at least for the time.</MPQASENT>


                      <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To W. D. Howells, in New York:

                                             Monday, Oct. 26, '08.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oh, I say!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where are you hiding, and why are you hiding?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You promised
to come here and you didn't keep your word.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(This sounds like
astonishment--but don't be misled by that.)</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Come, fire up again on your fiction-mill and give us another good
promise.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And this time keep it--for it is your turn to be astonished.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Come and stay as long as you possibly can.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I invented a new copyright
extension scheme last Friday, and sat up all night arranging its details.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It will interest you.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yesterday I got it down on paper in as compact a
form as I could.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Harvey and I have examined the scheme, and to-morrow or
next day he will send me a couple of copyright-experts to arrange about
getting certain statistics for me.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Authors, publishers and the public have always been damaged by the
copyright laws.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The proposed amendment will advantage all three--the
public most of all.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I think Congress will pass it and settle the vexed
question permanently.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I shall need your assent and the assent of about a dozen other authors.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also the assent of all the large firms of the 300 publishers.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These
authors and publishers will furnish said assent I am sure.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not even the
pirates will be able to furnish a serious objection, I think.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Come along.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This place seemed at its best when all around was summer-
green; later it seemed at its best when all around was burning with the
autumn splendors; and now once more it seems at its best, with the trees
naked and the ground a painter's palette.</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yours ever,
                                             MARK.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Clemens was a great admirer of the sea stories of W. W. Jacobs and
     generally kept one or more of this author's volumes in reach of his
     bed, where most of his reading was done.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The acknowledgment that
     follows was sent when he had finished Salthaven.</MPQASENT>


                       <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To W. W. Jacobs, in England:

                                                       REDDING, CONN,
                                                       Oct. 28, '08.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DEAR MR. JACOBS,--It has a delightful look.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I will not venture to say
how delightful, because the words would sound extravagant, and would
thereby lose some of their strength and to that degree misrepresent me.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is my conviction that Dialstone Lane holds the supremacy over all
purely humorous books in our language, but I feel about Salthaven as the
Cape Cod poet feels about Simon Hanks:

               "The Lord knows all things, great and small,
               With doubt he's not perplexed:
               'Tis Him alone that knows it all
               But Simon Hanks comes next."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The poet was moved by envy and malice and jealousy, but I am not: I place
Salthaven close up next to Dialstone because I think it has a fair and
honest right to that high position.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have kept the other book moving;
I shall begin to hand this one around now.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And many thanks to you for remembering me.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This house is out in the solitudes of the woods and the hills, an hour
and a half from New York, and I mean to stay in it winter and summer the
rest of my days.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I beg you to come and help occupy it a few days the
next time you visit the U.S.
                         Sincerely yours,
                                   S. L. CLEMENS.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the attractions of Stormfield was a beautiful mantel in the
     billiard room, presented by the Hawaiian Promotion Committee.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It
     had not arrived when the rest of the house was completed, but came
     in time to be set in place early in the morning of the owner's
     seventy-third birthday.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was made of a variety of Hawaiian woods,
     and was the work of a native carver, F. M. Otremba.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clemens was
     deeply touched by the offering from those "western isles"--the
     memory of which was always so sweet to him.</MPQASENT>


                         <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Mr. Wood, in Hawaii:

                                                       Nov. 30, '08.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DEAR MR. WOOD,--The beautiful mantel was put in its place an hour ago,
and its friendly "Aloha" was the first uttered greeting my 73rd birthday
received.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is rich in color, rich in quality, and rich in decoration,
therefore it exactly harmonizes with the taste for such things which was
born in me and which I have seldom been able to indulge to my content.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It will be a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">great</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">pleasure</MPQAPOL> to me, daily renewed, to have under my eye
this <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">lovely</MPQAPOL> reminder of the loveliest fleet of islands that <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">lies</MPQAPOL> anchored
in any ocean, and I <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">beg</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">thank</MPQAPOL> the Committee for providing me that
<MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">pleasure</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
                    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Sincerely</MPQAPOL> Yours,
