<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Clemens was still not without hope in the machine, at the beginning of
the new year (1891) but it was a hope no longer active, and it presently
became a moribund.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Jones, on about the middle of February, backed out
altogether, laying the blame chiefly on Mackay and the others, who, he
said, had decided not to invest.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jones "let his victim down easy" with
friendly words, but it was the end, for the present, at least, of machine
financiering.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was also the end of Mark Twain's capital.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His publishing business was
not good.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was already in debt and needing more money.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was just
one thing for him to do and he did it at once, not stopping to cry over
spilt milk, but with good courage and the old enthusiasm that never
failed him, he returned to the trade of authorship.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He dug out half-
finished articles and stories, finished them and sold them, and within a
week after the Jones collapse he was at work on a novel based an the old
Sellers idea, which eight years before he and Howells had worked into a
play.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The brief letter in which he reported this news to Howells bears
no marks of depression, though the writer of it was in his fifty-sixth
year; he was by no means well, and his financial prospects were anything
but golden.</MPQASENT>

DEAR HOWELLS,--Mrs. Clemens has been sick abed for near two weeks, but is
up and around the room now, and gaining.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I don't know whether she has
written Mrs. Howells or not--I only know she was going to--and will yet,
if she hasn't.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We are promising ourselves a whole world of pleasure in
the visit, and you mustn't dream of disappointing us.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Probably Mark Twain did not return to literary work reluctantly.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had
always enjoyed writing and felt now that he was equipped better than ever
for authorship, at least so far as material was concerned.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There exists
a fragmentary copy of a letter to some unknown correspondent, in which he
recites his qualifications.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It bears evidence of having been written
just at this time and is of unusual interest at this point.</MPQASENT>


                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fragment of Letter to -------, 1891:

.  .  .  .</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I confine myself to life with which I am familiar when
pretending to portray life.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I confined myself to the boy-life out on
the Mississippi because that had a peculiar charm for me, and not because
I was not familiar with other phases of life.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I was a soldier two weeks
once in the beginning of the war, and was hunted like a rat the whole
time.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Familiar?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">My splendid Kipling himself hasn't a more burnt-in,
hard-baked, and unforgetable familiarity with that death-on-the-pale-
horse-with-hell-following-after, which is a raw soldier's first fortnight
in the field--and which, without any doubt, is the most tremendous
fortnight and the vividest he is ever going to see.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yes, and I have shoveled silver tailings in a quartz-mill a couple of
weeks, and acquired the last possibilities of culture in that direction.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And I've done "pocket-mining" during three months in the one little patch
of ground in the whole globe where Nature conceals gold in pockets--or
did before we robbed all of those pockets and exhausted, obliterated,
annihilated the most curious freak Nature ever indulged in.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There are
not thirty men left alive who, being told there was a pocket hidden on
the broad slope of a mountain, would know how to go and find it, or have
even the faintest idea of how to set about it; but I am one of the
possible 20 or 30 who possess the secret, and I could go and put my hand
on that hidden treasure with a most deadly precision.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And I've been a prospector, and know pay rock from poor when I find it--
just with a touch of the tongue.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And I've been a silver miner and know
how to dig and shovel and drill and put in a blast.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And so I know the
mines and the miners interiorly as well as Bret Harte knows them
exteriorly.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And I was a newspaper reporter four years in cities, and so saw the
inside of many things; and was reporter in a legislature two sessions
and the same in Congress one session, and thus learned to know personally
three sample bodies of the smallest minds and the selfishest souls and
the cowardliest hearts that God makes.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And I was some years a Mississippi pilot, and familiarly knew all the
different kinds of steam-boatmen--a race apart, and not like other folk.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And I was for some years a traveling "jour" printer, and wandered from
city to city--and so I know that sect familiarly.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And I was a lecturer on the public platform a number of seasons and was a
responder to toasts at all the different kinds of banquets--and so I know
a great many secrets about audiences--secrets not to be got out of books,
but only acquirable by experience.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And I watched over one dear project of mine for years, spent a fortune on
it, and failed to make it go--and the history of that would make a large
book in which a million men would see themselves as in a mirror; and they
would testify and say, Verily, this is not imagination; this fellow has
been there--and after would cast dust upon their heads, cursing and
blaspheming.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And I am a publisher, and did pay to one author's widow (General Grant's)
the largest copyright checks this world has seen--aggregating more than
L80,000 in the first year.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And I have been an author for 20 years and an ass for 55.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now then; as the most valuable capital or culture or education usable in
the building of novels is personal experience I ought to be well equipped
for that trade.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I surely have the equipment, a wide culture, and all of it real, none of
it artificial, for I don't know anything about books.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clemens for several years had been bothered by rheumatism in his
     shoulder.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The return now to the steady use of the pen aggravated
     his trouble, and at times he was nearly disabled.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The phonograph
     for commercial dictation had been tried experimentally, and Mark
     Twain was always ready for any innovation.</MPQASENT>


                       <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To W. D. Howells, in Boston:

                                        HARTFORD, Feb.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">28, '91.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DEAR HOWELLS,--Won't you drop-in at the Boylston Building (New England
Phonograph Co) and talk into a phonograph in an ordinary conversation-
voice and see if another person (who didn't hear you do it) can take the
words from the thing without difficulty and repeat them to you.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the
experiment is satisfactory (also make somebody put in a message which you
don't hear, and see if afterward you can get it out without difficulty)
won't you then ask them on what terms they will rent me a phonograph for
3 months and furnish me cylinders enough to carry 75,000 words.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">175
cylinders, ain't it?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I don't want to erase any of them.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">My right arm is nearly disabled by
rheumatism, but I am bound to write this book (and sell 100,000 copies of
it--no, I mean a million--next fall) I feel sure I can dictate the book
into a phonograph if I don't have to yell.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I write 2,000 words a day; I
think I can dictate twice as many.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But mind, if this is going to be too much trouble to you--go ahead and do
it, all the same.</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ys ever
                                             MARK.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Howells, always willing to help, visited the phonograph place, and a
     few days later reported results.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wrote: "I talked your letter
     into a fonograf in my usual tone at my usual gait of speech.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then
     the fonograf man talked his answer in at his wonted swing and swell.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then we took the cylinder to a type-writer in the next room, and she
     put the hooks into her ears and wrote the whole out.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I send you the
     result.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a mistake of one word.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I think that if you have
     the cheek to dictate the story into the fonograf, all the rest is
     perfectly easy.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It wouldn't fatigue me to talk for an hour as I
     did."</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Clemens did not find the phonograph entirely satisfactory, at least
     not for a time, and he appears never to have used it steadily.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His
     early experience with it, however, seems interesting.</MPQASENT>


                       <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To W. D. Howells, in Boston:

                                        HARTFORD, Apl.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">4, '91.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">DEAR HOWELLS,--I'm ashamed.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It happened in this way.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I was proposing to
acknowledge the receipt of the play and the little book per phonograph,
so that you could see that the instrument is good enough for mere letter-
writing; then I meant to add the fact that you can't write literature
with it, because it hasn't any ideas and it hasn't any gift for
elaboration, or smartness of talk, or vigor of action, or felicity of
expression, but is just matter-of-fact, compressive, unornamental, and as
grave and unsmiling as the devil.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I filled four dozen cylinders in two sittings, then found I could have
said about as much with the pen and said it a deal better.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then I
resigned.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I believe it could teach one to dictate literature to a phonographer--and
some time I will experiment in that line.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The little book is charmingly written, and it interested me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it
flies too high for me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Its concretest things are filmy abstractions to
me, and when I lay my grip on one of them and open my hand, I feel as
embarrassed as I use to feel when I thought I had caught a fly.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I'm
going to try to mail it back to you to-day--I mean I am going to charge
my memory.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Charging my memory is one of my chief industries ....

With our loves and our kindest regards distributed among you according to
the proprieties.</MPQASENT>
                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yrs ever
                                        MARK.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">P. S.--I'm sending that ancient "Mental Telegraphy" article to Harper's
--with a modest postscript.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Probably read it to you years ago.</MPQASENT>

     The "little book" mentioned in this letter was by Swedenborg, an
     author in whom the Boston literary set was always deeply interested.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"Mental Telegraphy" appeared in Harper's Magazine, and is now
     included in the Uniform Edition of Mark Twain's books.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was
     written in 1878.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Joe Goodman had long since returned to California, it being clear
     that nothing could be gained by remaining in Washington.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On receipt
     of the news of the type-setter's collapse he sent a consoling word.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps he thought Clemens would rage over the unhappy circumstance,
     and possibly hold him in some measure to blame.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But it was
     generally the smaller annoyances of life that made Mark Twain rage;
     the larger catastrophes were likely to stir only his philosophy.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Library of American Literature, mentioned in the following
     letter, was a work in many volumes, edited by Edmund Clarence
     Stedman and Ellen Mackay Hutchinson.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">DEAR JOE, Well, it's all right, anyway.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Diplomacy couldn't have saved
it--diplomacy of mine--at that late day.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I hadn't any diplomacy in
stock, anyway.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In order to meet Jones's requirements I had to surrender
the old contract (a contract which made me boss of the situation and gave
me the whip-hand of Paige) and allow the new one to be drafted and put in
its place.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I was running an immense risk, but it was justified by
Jones's promises--promises made to me not merely once but every time I
tallied with him.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When February arrived, I saw signs which were mighty
plain reading.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Signs which meant that Paige was hoping and praying that
Jones would go back on me--which would leave Paige boss, and me robbed
and out in the cold.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His prayers were answered, and I am out in the
cold.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">If I ever get back my nine-twentieths interest, it will be by law-
suit--which will be instituted in the indefinite future, when the time
comes.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am at work again--on a book.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Not with a great deal of spirit, but with
enough--yes, plenty.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And I am pushing my publishing house.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It has
turned the corner after cleaning $50,000 a year for three consecutive
years, and piling every cent of it into one book--Library of American
Literature--and from next January onward it will resume dividends.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But
I've got to earn $50,000 for it between now and then--which I will do if
I keep my health.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This additional capital is needed for that same book,
because its prosperity is growing so great and exacting.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is dreadful to think of you in ill health--I can't realize it; you are
always to me the same that you were in those days when matchless health.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">and glowing spirits and delight in life were commonplaces with us.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lord
save us all from old age and broken health and a hope-tree that has lost
the faculty of putting out blossoms.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Mrs. Clemens was poorly, and his own health was uncertain.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They
     believed that some of the European baths would help them.</MPQASENT>

     Hartford home.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In Europe life could be simpler and vastly cheaper.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was offered a thousand dollars apiece for six European letters,
     by the McClure syndicate and W. M. Laffan, of the Sun.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This would

our coachman, who has been with us a 21 years, and is sober, active,
diligent, and unusually bright and capable.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You spoke of hiring a

it by Rhine traffic-boat and country stage-coach.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Come, get "sick or
sorry enough" and join us.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We shall be a little while at that bath, and
the rest of the summer at Annecy (this confidential to you) in Haute
Savoie, 22 miles from Geneva.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Spend the winters in Berlin.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I don't know
how long we shall be in Europe--I have a vote, but I don't cast it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'm
going to do whatever the others desire, with leave to change their mind,
without prejudice, whenever they want to.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Travel has no longer, any
charm for me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have seen all the foreign countries I want to see except
heaven and hell, and I have only a vague curiosity as concerns one of
those.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I found I couldn't use the play--I had departed too far from its lines
when I came to look at it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I thought I might get a great deal of
dialogue out of it, but I got only 15 loosely written pages--they saved
me half a days work.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the cursing phonograph.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There was abundance
of good dialogue, but it couldn't befitted into the new conditions of the
story.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Oh, look here--I did to-day what I have several times in past years
thought of doing: answered an interviewing proposition from a rich
newspaper with the reminder that they had not stated the terms; that my
time was all occupied with writing, at good pay, and that as talking was
harder work I should not care to venture it unless I knew the pay was
going to be proportionately higher.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I wish I had thought of this the
other day when Charley Stoddard turned a pleasant Englishman loose on me
and I couldn't think of any rational excuse.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Clemens had finished his Sellers book and had disposed of the serial
     rights to the McClure syndicate.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The house in Hartford was closed
     early in June, and on the 6th the family, with one maid, Katie
     Leary, sailed on the Gascogne.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Two weeks later they had begun a
     residence abroad which was to last for more than nine years.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was not easy to get to work in Europe.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clemens's arm remained
     lame, and any effort at writing brought suffering.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Century
     Magazine proposed another set of letters, but by the end of July he
     had barely begun on those promised to McClure and Laffan.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In
     August, however, he was able to send three: one from Aix about the
     baths there, another from Bayreuth concerning the Wagner festival,
     and a third from Marienbad, in Bohemia, where they rested for a
     time.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He decided that he would arrange for no more European letters
     when the six were finished, but would gather material for a book.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would take a courier and a kodak and go tramping again in some
     fashion that would be interesting to do and to write.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The idea finally matured when he reached Switzerland and settled the
     family at the Hotel Beau Rivage, Ouchy, Lausanne, facing Lake Leman.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He decided to make a floating trip down the Rhone, and he engaged
     Joseph Very, a courier that had served him on a former European
     trip, to accompany him.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The courier went over to Bourget and bought
     for five dollars a flat-bottomed boat and engaged its owner as their
     pilot.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was the morning of September 20, when they began their
     floating-trip down the beautiful historic river that flows through
     the loveliest and most romantic region of France.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He wrote daily to
     Mrs. Clemens, and his letters tell the story of that drowsy, happy
     experience better than the notes made with a view to publication.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Clemens had arrived at Lake Bourget on the evening before the
     morning of their start and slept on the Island of Chatillon, in an
     old castle of the same name.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lake Bourget connects with the Rhone

showing above the trees.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a wonderfully still place to sleep in.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">3.15 p. m.  Sunday.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We have been in the Rhone 3 hours.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is
unimaginably still and reposeful and cool and soft and breezy.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">No rowing
or work of any kind to do--we merely float with the current--we glide
noiseless and swift--as fast as a London cab-horse rips along--8 miles an
hour--the swiftest current I've ever boated in.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We have the entire river
to ourselves--nowhere a boat of any kind.</MPQASENT>

                                             [Sept. 21, 1891]
Name of the village which we left five minutes ago.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We went ashore at 5 p. m.  yesterday, dear heart, and walked a short mile
to St. Geuix, a big village, and took quarters at the principal inn; had
a good dinner and afterwards along walk out of town on the banks of the
Guiers till 7.30.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Went to bed at 8.30 and continued to make notes and read books and
newspapers till midnight.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Slept until 8, breakfasted in bed, and lay
till noon, because there had been a very heavy rain in the night and the
day was still dark and lowering.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But at noon the sun broke through and
in 15 minutes we were tramping toward the river.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Got afloat at 1 p. m.
but at 2.40 we had to rush suddenly ashore and take refuge in the above
village.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Just as we got ourselves and traps safely housed in the inn,
the rain let go and came down in great style.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We lost an hour and a half
there, but we are off again, now, with bright sunshine.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I wrote you yesterday my darling, and shall expect to write you every
day.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Good-day, and love to all of you.</MPQASENT>

                                        <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">ON THE RHONE BELOW VILLEBOIS,
                                                  Tuesday noon.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Good morning, sweetheart.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Night caught us yesterday where we had to take
quarters in a peasant's house which was occupied by the family and a lot
of cows and calves--also several rabbits.<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">--[His word for fleas.]<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">--The
latter had a ball, and I was the ball-room; but they were very friendly
and didn't bite.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The peasants were mighty kind and hearty, and flew around and did their
best to make us comfortable.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This morning I breakfasted on the shore in
the open air with two sociable dogs and a cat.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Clean cloth, napkin and
table furniture, white sugar, a vast hunk of excellent butter, good
bread, first class coffee with pure milk, fried fish just caught.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Wonderful that so much cleanliness should come out of such a phenomenally
dirty house.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">An hour ago we saw the Falls of the Rhone, a prodigiously rough and
dangerous looking place; shipped a little water but came to no harm.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was one of the most beautiful pieces of piloting and boat-management
I ever saw.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Our admiral knew his business.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">We have had to run ashore for shelter every time it has rained
heretofore, but Joseph has been putting in his odd time making a water-
proof sun-bonnet for the boat, and now we sail along dry although we had
many heavy showers this morning.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With a word of love to you all and particularly you,
                                                       SAML.</MPQASENT>


                                             <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">ON THE RHONE, BELOW VIENNA.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I salute you, my darling.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Your telegram reached me in Lyons last night
and was very pleasant news indeed.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I was up and shaved before 8 this morning, but we got delayed and didn't
sail from Lyons till 10.3O--an hour and a half lost.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And we've lost
another hour--two of them, I guess--since, by an error.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We came in sight
of Vienne at 2 o'clock, several miles ahead, on a hill, and I proposed to
walk down there and let the boat go ahead of us.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So Joseph and I got out
and struck through a willow swamp along a dim path, and by and by came
out on the steep bank of a slough or inlet or something, and we followed
that bank forever and ever trying to get around the head of that slough.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally I noticed a twig standing up in the water, and by George it had a
distinct and even vigorous quiver to it!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I don't know when I have felt
so much like a donkey.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On an island!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I wanted to drown somebody, but I
hadn't anybody I could spare.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, after another long tramp we found
a lonely native, and he had a scow and soon we were on the mainland--yes,
and a blamed sight further from Vienne than we were when we started.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Notes--I make millions of them; and so I get no time to write to you.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If
you've got a pad there, please send it poste-restante to Avignon.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I may
not need it but I fear I shall.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I'm straining to reach St. Pierre de Boef, but it's going to be a close
fit, I reckon.</MPQASENT>


                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">AFLOAT, Friday, 3 p.m., '91.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Livy darling, we sailed from St. Pierre de Boef six hours ago, and are
now approaching Tournon, where we shall not stop, but go on and make
Valence, a City Of 25,000 people.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It's too delicious, floating with the
swift current under the awning these superb sunshiny days in deep peace
and quietness.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Some of these curious old historical towns strangely
persuade me, but it is so lovely afloat that I don't stop, but view them
from the outside and sail on.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We get abundance of grapes and peaches for
next to nothing.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Joseph is perfect.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is at his very best--and never was better in his
life.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I guess he gets discouraged and feels disliked and in the way when
he is lying around--but here he is perfection, and brim full of useful
alacrities and helps and ingenuities.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When I woke up an hour ago and heard the clock strike 4, I said "I seem
to have been asleep an immensely long time; I must have gone to bed
mighty early; I wonder what time I did go to bed."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And I got up and lit
a candle and looked at my watch to see.</MPQASENT>


                                                       <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">AFLOAT
                                        2 HOURS BELOW BOURG ST. ANDEOL.</MPQASENT>
                                        <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Monday, 11 a.m., Sept. 28.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Livy darling, I didn't write yesterday.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We left La Voulte in a driving
storm of cold rain--couldn't write in it--and at 1 p. m.  when we were
not thinking of stopping, we saw a picturesque and mighty ruin on a high
hill back of a village, and I was seized with a desire to explore it; so
we landed at once and set out with rubbers and umbrella, sending the boat
ahead to St. Andeol, and we spent 3 hours clambering about those cloudy
heights among those worn and vast and idiotic ruins of a castle built by
two crusaders 650 years ago.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The work of these asses was full of
interest, and we had a good time inspecting, examining and scrutinizing
it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All the hills on both sides of the Rhone have peaks and precipices,
and each has its gray and wasted pile of mouldy walls and broken towers.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Romans displaced the Gauls, the Visigoths displaced the Romans, the
Saracens displaced the Visigoths, the Christians displaced the Saracens,
and it was these pious animals who built these strange lairs and cut each
other's throats in the name and for the glory of God, and robbed and
burned and slew in peace and war; and the pauper and the slave built
churches, and the credit of it went to the Bishop who racked the money
out of them.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">These are pathetic shores, and they make one despise the
human race.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We came down in an hour by rail, but I couldn't get your telegram till
this morning, for it was Sunday and they had shut up the post office to
go to the circus.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I went, too.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was all one family--parents and 5
children--performing in the open air to 200 of these enchanted villagers,
who contributed coppers when called on.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a most gay and strange
and pathetic show.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I got up at 7 this morning to see the poor devils
cook their poor breakfast and pack up their sordid fineries.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is a 9 k-m.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">current and the wind is with us; we shall make Avignon
before 4 o'clock.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I saw watermelons and pomegranates for sale at St.
Andeol.</MPQASENT>

               <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With a power of love, Sweetheart,
                                                  SAML.</MPQASENT>


                                             <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">HOTEL D'EUROPE, AVIGNON,
                                             Monday, 6 p.m., Sept. 28.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well, Livy darling, I have been having a perfect feast of letters for an
hour, and I thank you and dear Clam with all my heart.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It's like hearing
from home after a long absence.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is early to be in bed, but I'm always abed before 9, on this voyage;
and up at 7 or a trifle later, every morning.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">If I ever take such a trip
again, I will have myself called at the first tinge of dawn and get to
sea as soon after as possible.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The early dawn on the water-nothing can
be finer, as I know by old Mississippi experience.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I did so long for you
and Sue yesterday morning--the most superb sunrise!<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">--the most marvelous
sunrise!</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">and I saw it all from the very faintest suspicion of the coming
dawn all the way through to the final explosion of glory.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But it had
interest private to itself and not to be found elsewhere in the world;
for between me and it, in the far distant-eastward, was a silhouette
mountain-range in which I had discovered, the previous afternoon, a most
noble face upturned to the sky, and mighty form out stretched, which I
had named Napoleon Dreaming of Universal Empire--and now, this prodigious
face, soft, rich, blue, spirituelle, asleep, tranquil, reposeful, lay
against that giant conflagration of ruddy and golden splendors all rayed
like a wheel with the upstreaming and far-reaching lances of the sun.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It
made one want to cry for delight, it was so supreme in its unimaginable
majesty and beauty.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We had a curious experience today.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A little after I had sealed and
directed my letter to you, in which I said we should make Avignon before
4, we got lost.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We ceased to encounter any village or ruin mentioned in
our "particularizes" and detailed Guide of the Rhone--went drifting along
by the hour in a wholly unknown land and on an uncharted river!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Confound
it, we stopped talking and did nothing but stand up in the boat and
search the horizons with the glass and wonder what in the devil had
happened.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And at last, away yonder at 5 o'clock when some east towers
and fortresses hove in sight we couldn't recognize them for Avignon--yet
we knew by the broken bridge that it was Avignon.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then we saw what the trouble was--at some time or other we had drifted
down the wrong side of an island and followed a sluggish branch of the
Rhone not frequented in modern times.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We lost an hour and a half by it
and missed one of the most picturesque and gigantic and history-sodden
masses of castellated medieval ruin that Europe can show.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was dark by the time we had wandered through the town and got the
letters and found the hotel--so I went to bed.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We shall leave here at noon tomorrow and float down to Arles, arriving
about dark, and there bid good bye to the boat, the river-trip finished.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Between Arles and Nimes (and Avignon again,) we shall be till Saturday
morning--then rail it through on that day to Ouchy, reaching the hotel at
11 at night if the train isn't late.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Next day (Sunday) if you like, go to Basel, and Monday to Berlin.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But I
shall be at your disposal, to do exactly as you desire and prefer.</MPQASENT>

          <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With no end of love to all of you and twice as much to you,
               sweetheart,
                         SAML.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believe my arm is a trifle better than it was when I started.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The mention in the foregoing letter of the Napoleon effigy is the
     beginning of what proved to be a rather interesting episode.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Mark
     Twain thought a great deal of his discovery, as he called it--the
     giant figure of Napoleon outlined by the distant mountain range.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In his note-book he entered memoranda telling just where it was to
     be seen, and added a pencil sketch of the huge profile.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But then he
     characteristically forgot all about it, and when he recalled the
     incident ten years later, he could not remember the name of the
     village, Beauchastel, from which the great figure could be seen;
     also, that he had made a record of the place.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he was by this time more certain than ever that his discovery
     was a remarkable one, which, if known, would become one of the great
     natural wonders, such as Niagara Falls.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Theodore Stanton was
     visiting him at the time, and Clemens urged him, on his return to
     France, to make an excursion to the Rhone and locate the Lost
     Napoleon, as he now called it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But Clemens remembered the wonder as
     being somewhere between Arles and Avignon, instead of about a
     hundred miles above the last-named town.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stanton naturally failed
     to find it, and it remained for the writer of these notes, motoring
     up the Rhone one September day, exactly twenty-two years after the
     first discovery, to re-locate the vast reclining figure of the first
     consul of France, "dreaming of Universal Empire."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The re-discovery
     was not difficult--with Mark Twain's memoranda as a guide--and it
     was worth while.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Perhaps the Lost Napoleon is not so important a
     natural wonder as Mark Twain believed, but it is a striking picture,
     and on a clear day the calm blue face outlined against the sky will
     long hold the traveler's attention.</MPQASENT>

                 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Clara Clemens, in Ouchy, Switzerland:

                              AFLOAT, 11.20 a.m., Sept. 29, Tuesday.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DEAR OLD BEN,--The vast stone masses and huge towers of the ancient papal
palace of Avignon are projected above an intervening wooded island a mile
up the river behind me--for we are already on our way to Arles.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is a
perfectly still morning, with a brilliant sun, and very hot--outside; but
I am under cover of the linen hood, and it is cool and shady in here.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Please tell mamma I got her very last letter this morning, and I perceive
by it that I do not need to arrive at Ouchy before Saturday midnight.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am glad, because I couldn't do the railroading I am proposing to do
during the next two or three days and get there earlier.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I could put in
the time till Sunday midnight, but shall not venture it without
telegraphic instructions from her to Nimes day after tomorrow, Oct. 1,
care Hotel Manivet.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The only adventures we have is in drifting into rough seas now and then.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They are not dangerous, but they go thro' all the motions of it.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yesterday when we shot the Bridge of the Holy Spirit it was probably in
charge of some inexperienced deputy spirit for the day, for we were
allowed to go through the wrong arch, which brought us into a tourbillon
below which tried to make this old scow stand on its head.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of course I
lost my temper and blew it off in a way to be heard above the roar of the
tossing waters.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I lost it because the admiral had taken that arch in
deference to my opinion that it was the best one, while his own judgment
told him to take the one nearest the other side of the river.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I could
have poisoned him I was so mad to think I had hired such a turnip.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A boatman in command should obey nobody's orders but his own, and yield
to nobody's suggestions.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was very sweet of you to write me, dear, and I thank you ever so much.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With greatest love and kisses,
                                   PAPA.</MPQASENT>


                 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Clemens, in Ouchy, Switzerland:

                                             ARLES, Sept. 30, noon.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Livy darling, I hain't got no time to write today, because I am sight
seeing industriously and imagining my chapter.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Bade good-bye to the river trip and gave away the boat yesterday evening.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We had ten great days in her.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We reached here after dark.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We were due about 4.30, counting by
distance, but we couldn't calculate on such a lifeless current as we
found.</MPQASENT>
               <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I love you, sweetheart.</MPQASENT>
                                        <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">SAML.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">It had been a long time since Clemens had written to his old friend
     Twichell, but the Rhone trip must have reminded him of those days
     thirteen years earlier, when, comparatively young men, he and
     Twichell were tramping through the Black Forest and scaling Gemmi
     Pass.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He sent Twichell a reminder of that happy time.</MPQASENT>


              <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Rev. Joseph H. Twichell, in Hartford, Conn:

                                                  NIMES, Oct. 1, '91.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">DEAR JOE,--I have been ten days floating down the Rhone on a raft, from
Lake Bourget, and a most curious and darling kind of a trip it has been.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">You ought to have been along--I could have made room for you easily--and
you would have found that a pedestrian tour in Europe doesn't begin with
a raft-voyage for hilarity and mild adventure, and intimate contact with
the unvisited native of the back settlements, and extinction from the
world and newspapers, and a conscience in a state of coma, and lazy
comfort, and solid happiness.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact there's nothing that's so lovely.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But it's all over.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I gave the raft away yesterday at Arles, and am
loafing along back by short stages on the rail to Ouchy-Lausanne where
the tribe are staying.</MPQASENT>
                         <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Love to you all
                                        MARK.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Clemenses settled in Berlin for the winter, at 7 Kornerstrasse,
     and later at the Hotel Royal.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There had been no permanent
     improvement in Mark Twain's arm and he found writing difficult.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some of the letters promised to Laffan and McClure were still
     unfinished.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Young Hall, his publishing manager in America, was working hard to
     keep the business afloat, and being full of the optimism of his
     years did not fail to make as good a showing as he could.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We may
     believe his letters were very welcome to Clemens and his wife, who
     found little enough in the general prospect to comfort them.</MPQASENT>


                        <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Mr. Hall, in New York:

                                                  BERLIN, Nov. 27, '91.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">DEAR MR. HALL,--That kind of a statement is valuable.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It came this
morning.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is the first time since the business began that I have had
a report that furnished the kind of information I wanted, and was really
enlightening and satisfactory.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Keep it up.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Don't let it fall into
desuetude.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Everything looks so fine and handsome with the business, now, that I feel
a great let-up from depression.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The rewards of your long and patient
industry are on their way, and their arrival safe in port, presently,
seems assured.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By George, I shall be glad when the ship comes in!</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My arm is so much better that I was able to make a speech last night to
250 Americans.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But when they threw my portrait on the screen it was a
sorrowful reminder, for it was from a negative of 15 years ago, and
hadn't a gray hair in it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And now that my arm is better, I have stolen a
couple of days and finished up a couple of McClure letters that have been
lying a long time.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I shall mail one of them to you next Tuesday--registered.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lookout for
it.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I shall register and mail the other one (concerning the "Jungfrau") next
Friday look out for it also, and drop me a line to let me know they have
arrived.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I shall write the 6th and last letter by and by when I have studied
Berlin sufficiently.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Yours in a most cheerful frame of mind, and with my and all the family's
Thanksgiving greetings and best wishes,
                                        S. L. CLEMENS.</MPQASENT>


       <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Postscript by Mrs. Clemens written on Mr. Clemens's letter:

DEAR MR. HALL,--This is my birthday and your letter this morning was a
happy addition to the little gifts on the breakfast table.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I thought of
going out and spending money for something unnecessary after it came, but
concluded perhaps I better wait a little longer.</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sincerely yours

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"The German Chicago" was the last of the six McClure letters and was
     finished that winter in Berlin.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is now included in the Uniform
     Edition of Mark Twain's works, and is one of the best descriptive
     articles of the German capital ever written.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He made no use of the
     Rhone notes further than to put them together in literary form.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They did not seem to him to contain enough substance to warrant
     publication.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A letter to Hall, written toward the end of December,
     we find rather gloomy in tone, though he is still able to extract

Among the MSS I left with you are a few that have a recent look and are
written on rather stiff pale green paper.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If you will have those type-
writered and keep the originals and send me the copies (one per mail, not
two.)</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I'll see if I can use them.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But tell Howells and other inquirers that my hopes of writing anything
are very slender--I seem to be disabled for life.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Drop McClure a line and tell him the same.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I can't dare to make an
engagement now for even a single letter.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I am glad Howells is on a magazine, but sorry he gave up the Study.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I shall have to go on a magazine myself if this L. A. L. continues to
hold my nose down to the grind-stone much longer.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'm going to hold my breath, now, for 30 days--then the annual statement
will arrive and I shall know how we feel!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Merry Xmas to you from us all.</MPQASENT>
