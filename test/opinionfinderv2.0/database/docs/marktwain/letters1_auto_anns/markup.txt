     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We have no record of Mark Twain's earliest letters.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Very likely
     they were soiled pencil notes, written to some school sweetheart--
     to "Becky Thatcher," perhaps--and tossed across at lucky moments,
     or otherwise, with happy or disastrous results.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of those
     smudgy, much-folded school notes of the Tom Sawyer period would be
     priceless to-day, and somewhere among forgotten keepsakes it may
     exist, but we shall not be likely to find it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No letter of his
     boyhood, no scrap of his earlier writing, has come to light except
     his penciled name, SAM CLEMENS, laboriously inscribed on the inside
     of a small worn purse that once held his meager, almost non-existent
     wealth.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He became a printer's apprentice at twelve, but as he
     received no salary, the need of a purse could not have been urgent.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He must have carried it pretty steadily, however, from its
     appearance--as a kind of symbol of hope, maybe--a token of that
     Sellers-optimism which dominated his early life, and was never
     entirely subdued.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No other writing of any kind has been preserved from Sam Clemens's
     boyhood, none from that period of his youth when he had served his
     apprenticeship and was a capable printer on his brother's paper, a
     contributor to it when occasion served.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Letters and manuscripts of
     those days have vanished--even his contributions in printed form are
     unobtainable.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is not believed that a single number of Orion
     Clemens's paper, the Hannibal Journal, exists to-day.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was not until he was seventeen years old that Sam Clemens wrote a
     letter any portion of which has survived.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was no longer in
     Hannibal.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Orion's unprosperous enterprise did not satisfy him.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His wish to earn money and to see the world had carried him first to
     St. Louis, where his sister Pamela was living, then to New York
     City, where a World's Fair in a Crystal Palace was in progress.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The letter tells of a visit to this great exhibition.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is not
     complete, and the fragment bears no date, but it was written during
     the summer of 1853.</MPQASENT>


      <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fragment of a letter from Sam L.  Clemens to his sister
           Pamela Moffett, in St. Louis, summer of 1853:

.  .  .</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the gallery (second floor) you have a glorious sight--the
flags of the different countries represented, the lofty dome, glittering
jewelry, gaudy tapestry, &c., with the busy crowd passing to and fro--tis
a perfect fairy palace--beautiful beyond description.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Machinery department is on the main floor, but I cannot enumerate any
of it on account of the lateness of the hour (past 8 o'clock.)</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It would
take more than a week to examine everything on exhibition; and as I was
only in a little over two hours tonight, I only glanced at about one-
third of the articles; and having a poor memory; I have enumerated
scarcely any of even the principal objects.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The visitors to the Palace
average 6,000 daily--double the population of Hannibal.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The price of
admission being 50 cents, they take in about $3,000.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Latting Observatory (height about 280 feet) is near the Palace--from
it you can obtain a grand view of the city and the country round.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The
Croton Aqueduct, to supply the city with water, is the greatest wonder
yet.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Immense sewers are laid across the bed of the Hudson River, and
pass through the country to Westchester county, where a whole river is
turned from its course, and brought to New York.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the reservoir in
the city to the Westchester county reservoir, the distance is thirty-
eight miles!</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">and if necessary, they could supply every family in New York
with one hundred barrels of water per day!</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am very sorry to learn that Henry has been sick.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He ought to go to the
country and take exercise; for he is not half so healthy as Ma thinks he
is.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he had my walking to do, he would be another boy entirely.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Four
times every day I walk a little over one mile; and working hard all day,
and walking four miles, is exercise--I am used to it, now, though, and it
is no trouble.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where is it Orion's going to?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Tell Ma my promises are
faithfully kept, and if I have my health I will take her to Ky. in the
spring--I shall save money for this.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Tell Jim and all the rest of them
to write, and give me all the news.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I am sorry to hear such bad news
from Will and Captain Bowen.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I shall write to Will soon.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Chatham-
square Post Office and the Broadway office too, are out of my way, and I
always go to the General Post Office; so you must write the direction of
my letters plain, "New York City, N. Y.," without giving the street or
anything of the kind, or they may go to some of the other offices.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(It
has just struck 2 A.M.  and I always get up at 6, and am at work at 7.)</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">You ask me where I spend my evenings.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Where would you suppose, with a
free printers' library containing more than 4,000 volumes within a
quarter of a mile of me, and nobody at home to talk to?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I shall write to
Ella soon.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Write soon
                         Truly your Brother
                                             SAM.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">P. S.  I have written this by a light so dim that you nor Ma could not
read by it.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was lodging in a mechanics' cheap boarding-house in Duane Street,
     and we may imagine the bareness of his room, the feeble poverty of
     his lamp.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">"Tell Ma my promises are faithfully kept."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was the day when he
     had left Hannibal.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His mother, Jane Clemens, a resolute, wiry woman
     of forty-nine, had put together his few belongings.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Then, holding
     up a little Testament:

     "I want you to take hold of the end of this, Sam," she said, "and
     make me a promise.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I want you to repeat after me these words:
     'I do solemnly swear that I will not throw a card, or drink a drop
     of liquor while I am gone.'"</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was this oath, repeated after her, that he was keeping
     faithfully.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Will Bowen mentioned is a former playmate, one of
     Tom Sawyer's outlaw band.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had gone on the river to learn
     piloting with an elder brother, the "Captain."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">What the bad news
     was is no longer remembered, but it could not have been very
     serious, for the Bowen boys remained on the river for many years.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"Ella" was Samuel Clemens's cousin and one-time sweetheart, Ella
     Creel.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"Jim" was Jim Wolfe, an apprentice in Orion's office, and
     the hero of an adventure which long after Mark Twain wrote under the
     title of, "Jim Wolfe and the Cats."</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is scarcely a hint of the future Mark Twain in this early
     letter.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is the letter of a boy of seventeen who is beginning to
     take himself rather seriously--who, finding himself for the first
     time far from home and equal to his own responsibilities, is willing
     to carry the responsibility of others.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Henry, his brother, three
     years younger, had been left in the printing-office with Orion, who,
     after a long, profitless fight, is planning to remove from Hannibal.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The young traveler is concerned as to the family outlook, and will
     furnish advice if invited.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He feels the approach of prosperity, and
     will take his mother on a long-coveted trip to her old home in the
     spring.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His evenings?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Where should he spend them, with a free
     library of four thousand volumes close by?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is distinctly a
     youthful letter, a bit pretentious, and wanting in the spontaneity
     and humor of a later time.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It invites comment, now, chiefly because
     it is the first surviving document in the long human story.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was working in the printing-office of John A. Gray and Green, on
     Cliff Street, and remained there through the summer.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He must have
     written more than once during this period, but the next existing
     letter--also to Sister Pamela--was written in October.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is
     perhaps a shade more natural in tone than the earlier example, and
     there is a hint of Mark Twain in the first paragraph.</MPQASENT>


                      <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:

                              NEW YORK .  .  .</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">, Oct.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Saturday '53.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">MY DEAR SISTER,--I have not written to any of the family for some time,
from the fact, firstly, that I didn't know where they were, and secondly,
because I have been fooling myself with the idea that I was going to
leave New York every day for the last two weeks.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have taken a liking
to the abominable place, and every time I get ready to leave, I put it
off a day or so, from some unaccountable cause.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is as hard on my
conscience to leave New York, as it was easy to leave Hannibal.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I think
I shall get off Tuesday, though.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Edwin Forrest has been playing, for the last sixteen days, at the
Broadway Theatre, but I never went to see him till last night.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The play
was the "Gladiator."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I did not like parts of it much, but other portions
were really splendid.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In the latter part of the last act, where the
"Gladiator" (Forrest) dies at his brother's feet, (in all the fierce
pleasure of gratified revenge,) the man's whole soul seems absorbed in
the part he is playing; and it is really startling to see him.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am
sorry I did not see him play "Damon and Pythias" the former character
being his greatest.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He appears in Philadelphia on Monday night.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have not received a letter from home lately, but got a "'Journal'" the
other day, in which I see the office has been sold.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I suppose Ma, Orion
and Henry are in St. Louis now.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If Orion has no other project in his
head, he ought to take the contract for getting out some weekly paper, if
he cannot get a foremanship.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now, for such a paper as the "Presbyterian"
(containing about 60,000,--[Sixty thousand ems, type measurement.])</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">he could get $20 or $25 per week, and he and Henry could easily do the
work; nothing to do but set the type and make up the forms....

If my letters do not come often, you need not bother yourself about me;
for if you have a brother nearly eighteen years of age, who is not able
to take care of himself a few miles from home, such a brother is not
worth one's thoughts: and if I don't manage to take care of No. 1, be
assured you will never know it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am not afraid, however; I shall ask
favors from no one, and endeavor to be (and shall be) as "independent as
a wood-sawyer's clerk."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I never saw such a place for military companies as New York.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Go on the
street when you will, you are sure to meet a company in full uniform,
with all the usual appendages of drums, fifes, &c.  I saw a large company
of soldiers of 1812 the other day, with a '76 veteran scattered here and
there in the ranks.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And as I passed through one of the parks lately,
I came upon a company of boys on parade.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Their uniforms were neat, and
their muskets about half the common size.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some of them were not more
than seven or eight years of age; but had evidently been well-drilled.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Passage to Albany (160 miles) on the finest steamers that ply' the
Hudson, is now 25 cents--cheap enough, but is generally cheaper than that
in the summer.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I want you to write as soon as I tell you where to direct your letter.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I would let you know now, if I knew myself.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I may perhaps be here a week
longer; but I cannot tell.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When you write tell me the whereabouts of the
family.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">My love to Mr. Moffett and Ella.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tell Ella I intend to write to
her soon, whether she wants me to nor not.</MPQASENT>
                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Truly your Brother,
                                        SAML L. CLEMENS.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was in Philadelphia when he wrote the nest letter that has come
     down to us, and apparently satisfied with the change.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is a
     letter to Orion Clemens, who had disposed of his paper, but
     evidently was still in Hannibal.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An extended description of a trip
     to Fairmount Park is omitted because of its length, its chief
     interest being the tendency it shows to descriptive writing--the
     field in which he would make his first great fame.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is,
     however, no hint of humor, and only a mild suggestion of the author
     of the Innocents Abroad in this early attempt.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The letter as here
     given is otherwise complete, the omissions being indicated.</MPQASENT>


                      <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Orion Clemens, in Hannibal:

                                   PHILADELPHIA, PA.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Oct. 26,1853.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">MY DEAR BROTHER,--It was at least two weeks before I left New York, that
I received my last letter from home: and since then, not a word have I
heard from any of you.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">And now, since I think of it, it wasn't a letter,
either, but the last number of the "Daily Journal," saying that that
paper was sold, and I very naturally supposed from that, that the family
had disbanded, and taken up winter quarters in St. Louis.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Therefore, I
have been writing to Pamela, till I've tired of it, and have received no
answer.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have been writing for the last two or three weeks, to send Ma
some money, but devil take me if I knew where she was, and so the money
has slipped out of my pocket somehow or other, but I have a dollar left,
and a good deal owing to me, which will be paid next Monday.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I shall
enclose the dollar in this letter, and you can hand it to her.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I know
it's a small amount, but then it will buy her a handkerchief, and at the
same time serve as a specimen of the kind of stuff we are paid with in
Philadelphia, for you see it's against the law, in Pennsylvania, to keep
or pass a bill of less denomination than $5.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have only seen two or
three bank bills since I have been in the State.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On Monday the hands are
paid off in sparkling gold, fresh from the Mint; so your dreams are not
troubled with the fear of having doubtful money in your pocket.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am subbing at the Inquirer office.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">One man has engaged me to work for
him every Sunday till the first of next April, (when I shall return home
to take Ma to Ky;) and another has engaged my services for the 24th of
next month; and if I want it, I can get subbing every night of the week.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I go to work at 7 o'clock in the evening, and work till 3 o'clock the
next morning.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I can go to the theatre and stay till 12 o'clock and then
go to the office, and get work from that till 3 the next morning; when I
go to bed, and sleep till 11 o'clock, then get up and loaf the rest of
the day.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The type is mostly agate and minion, with some bourgeois; and
when one gets a good agate take,--["Agate," "minion," etc., sizes of
type; "take," a piece of work.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Type measurement is by ems, meaning the
width of the letter 'm'.]<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">--he is sure to make money.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I made $2.50 last
Sunday, and was laughed at by all the hands, the poorest of whom sets
11,000 on Sunday; and if I don't set 10,000, at least, next Sunday, I'll
give them leave to laugh as much as they want to.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Out of the 22
compositors in this office, 12 at least, set 15,000 on Sunday.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Unlike New York, I like this Philadelphia amazingly, and the people in
it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is only one thing that gets my "dander" up--and that is the
hands are always encouraging me: telling me--"it's no use to get
discouraged--no use to be down-hearted, for there is more work here than
you can do!"</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"Down-hearted," the devil!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have not had a particle of
such a feeling since I left Hannibal, more than four months ago.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I fancy
they'll have to wait some time till they see me down-hearted or afraid of
starving while I have strength to work and am in a city of 400,000
inhabitants.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When I was in Hannibal, before I had scarcely stepped out
of the town limits, nothing could have convinced me that I would starve
as soon as I got a little way from home....

The grave of Franklin is in Christ Church-yard, corner of Fifth and Arch
streets.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They keep the gates locked, and one can only see the flat slab
that lies over his remains and that of his wife; but you cannot see the
inscription distinctly enough to read it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The inscription, I believe,
reads thus:

                        "Benjamin  |
                         and       |  Franklin"

I counted 27 cannons (6 pounders) planted in the edge of the sidewalk in
Water St. the other day.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They are driven into the ground, about a foot,
with the mouth end upwards.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A ball is driven fast into the mouth of
each, to exclude the water; they look like so many posts.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They were put
there during the war.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have also seen them planted in this manner,
round the old churches, in N. Y.....

There is one fine custom observed in Phila.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A gentleman is always
expected to hand up a lady's money for her.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yesterday, I sat in the
front end of the 'bus, directly under the driver's box--a lady sat
opposite me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">She handed me her money, which was right.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But, Lord!</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">a St. Louis lady would think herself ruined, if she should be so familiar

like an office clock, with figures from 0 to 40, marked on its face.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When the stage starts, the hand of the clock is turned toward the 0.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When you get in and pay your fare, the driver strikes a bell, and the
hand moves to the figure 1--that is, "one fare, and paid for," and there
is your receipt, as good as if you had it in your pocket.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When a
passenger pays his fare and the driver does not strike the bell
immediately, he is greeted "Strike that bell!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">will you?"</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I must close now.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I intend visiting the Navy Yard, Mint, etc., before I
write again.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You must write often.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You see I have nothing to write
interesting to you, while you can write nothing that will not interest
me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Don't say my letters are not long enough.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tell Jim Wolfe to write.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tell all the boys where I am, and to write.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Jim Robinson, particularly.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Those were primitive times.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Imagine a passenger in these easy-going days
calling to a driver or conductor to "Strike that bell!"</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"H--l" is his abbreviation for Hannibal.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had first used it in a title
of a poem which a few years before, during one of Orion's absences, he
had published in the paper.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"To Mary in Hannibal" was too long to set as
a display head in single column.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The poem had no great merit, but under
the abbreviated title it could hardly fail to invite notice.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was one
of several things he did to liven up the circulation during a brief
period of his authority.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The doubtful money he mentions was the paper issued by private banks,
"wild cat," as it was called.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He had been paid with it in New York,
and found it usually at a discount--sometimes even worthless.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Wages and
money were both better in Philadelphia, but the fund for his mother's
trip to Kentucky apparently did not grow very rapidly.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The next letter, written a month later, is also to Orion Clemens, who had
now moved to Muscatine, Iowa, and established there a new paper with an
old title, 'The Journal'.</MPQASENT>


                  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Orion Clemens, in Muscatine, Iowa:

                                   PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 28th, 1853.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">MY DEAR BROTHER,--I received your letter today.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I think Ma ought to
spend the winter in St. Louis.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I don't believe in that climate--it's too
cold for her.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The printers' annual ball and supper came off the other night.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The
proceeds amounted to about $1,000.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The printers, as well as other
people, are endeavoring to raise money to erect a monument to Franklin,
but there are so many abominable foreigners here (and among printers,
too,) who hate everything American, that I am very certain as much money
for such a purpose could be raised in St. Louis, as in Philadelphia.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I was in Franklin's old office this morning--the "North American"
(formerly "Philadelphia Gazette") and there was at least one foreigner
for every American at work there.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How many subscribers has the Journal got?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What does the job-work pay?</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">and what does the whole concern pay?<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">.....

I will try to write for the paper occasionally, but I fear my letters
will be very uninteresting, for this incessant night-work dulls one's
ideas amazingly.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">From some cause, I cannot set type nearly so fast as when I was at home.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sunday is a long day, and while others set 12 and 15,000, yesterday, I
only set 10,000.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, I will shake this laziness off, soon, I reckon
....

How do you like "free-soil?"<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">--I would like amazingly to see a good old-
fashioned negro.</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My love to all
                                        Truly your brother
                                                       SAM.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We may believe that it never occurred to the young printer, looking
     up landmarks of Ben Franklin, that time would show points of
     resemblance between the great Franklin's career and his own.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet
     these seem now rather striking.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Like Franklin, he had been taken
     out of school very young and put at the printer's trade; like
     Franklin, he had worked in his brother's office, and had written for
     the paper.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Like him, too, he had left quietly for New York and
     Philadelphia to work at the trade of printing, and in time Samuel
     Clemens, like Benjamin Franklin, would become a world-figure, many-
     sided, human, and of incredible popularity.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The boy Sam Clemens may
     have had such dreams, but we find no trace of them.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is but one more letter of this early period.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Young Clemens
     spent some time in Washington, but if he wrote from there his
     letters have disappeared.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The last letter is from Philadelphia and
     seems to reflect homesickness.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The novelty of absence and travel
     was wearing thin.</MPQASENT>


                      <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:

                                   PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 5, '53.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">MY DEAR SISTER,--I have already written two letters within the last two
hours, and you will excuse me if this is not lengthy.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If I had the
money, I would come to St. Louis now, while the river is open; but within
the last two or three weeks I have spent about thirty dollars for
clothing, so I suppose I shall remain where I am.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I only want to return
to avoid night-work, which is injuring my eyes.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have received one or
two letters from home, but they are not written as they should be, and I
know no more about what is going on there than the man in the moon.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One
only has to leave home to learn how to write an interesting letter to an
absent friend when he gets back.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I suppose you board at Mrs. Hunter's
yet--and that, I think, is somewhere in Olive street above Fifth.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Philadelphia is one of the healthiest places in the Union.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I wanted to
spend this winter in a warm climate, but it is too late now.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I don't
like our present prospect for cold weather at all.</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Truly your brother
                                                       SAM.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But he did not return to the West for another half year.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The
     letters he wrote during that period have not survived.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was late
     in the summer of 1854 when he finally started for St. Louis.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He sat
     up for three days and nights in a smoking-car to make the journey,
     and arrived exhausted.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The river packet was leaving in a few hours
     for Muscatine, Iowa, where his mother and his two brothers were now
     located.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He paid his sister a brief visit, and caught the boat.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Worn-out, he dropped into his berth and slept the thirty-six hours
     of the journey.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was early when-he arrived--too early to arouse the family.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In
     the office of the little hotel where he waited for daylight he found
     a small book.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It contained portraits of the English rulers, with
     the brief facts of their reigns.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Young Clemens entertained himself
     by learning this information by heart.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had a fine memory for
     such things, and in an hour or two had the printed data perfectly
     and permanently committed.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This incidentally acquired <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knowledge</MPQAPOL>
     <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">proved</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">immense</MPQAPOL> value to him.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was his groundwork for all
     English history.</MPQASENT>
