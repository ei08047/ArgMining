otherwise active in his support.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Upon Garfield's election, however, he

                                             HARTFORD, Jany.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">12, '81.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">GEN. GARFIELD

DEAR SIR,--Several times since your election persons wanting office have
asked me "to use my influence" with you in their behalf.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To word it in that way was such a pleasant compliment to me that I never
complied.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I could not without exposing the fact that I hadn't any
influence with you and that was a thing I had no mind to do.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It seems to me that it is better to have a good man's flattering estimate
of my influence--and to keep it--than to fool it away with trying to get
him an office.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But when my brother--on my wife's side--Mr. Charles J.
Langdon--late of the Chicago Convention--desires me to speak a word for
Mr. Fred Douglass, I am not asked "to use my influence" consequently I am
not risking anything.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So I am writing this as a simple citizen.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am
not drawing on my fund of influence at all.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A simple citizen may express
a desire with all propriety, in the matter of a recommendation to office,
and so I beg permission to hope that you will retain Mr. Douglass in his
present office of Marshall of the District of Columbia, if such a course
will not clash with your own preferences or with the expediencies and
interest of your administration.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I offer this petition with peculiar
pleasure and strong desire, because I so honor this man's high and
blemishless character and so admire his brave, long crusade for the
liberties and elevation of his race.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He is a personal friend of mine, but that is nothing to the point, his
history would move me to say these things without that, and I feel them
too.</MPQASENT>
               <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With great respect
                         I am, General,
                                   Yours truly,
                                        S. L. CLEMENS.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clemens would go out of his way any time to grant favor to the
     colored race.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His childhood associations were partly accountable
     for this, but he also felt that the white man owed the negro a debt
     for generations of enforced bondage.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would lecture any time in a
     colored church, when he would as likely as not refuse point-blank to
     speak for a white congregation.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Once, in Elmira, he received a
     request, poorly and none too politely phrased, to speak for one of
     the churches.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was annoyed and about to send a brief refusal,
     when Mrs. Clemens, who was present, said:

     "I think I know that church, and if so this preacher is a colored
     man; he does not know how to write a polished letter--how should
     he?"</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her husband's manner changed so suddenly that she added:
     "I will give you a motto, and it will be useful to you if you will
     adopt it: Consider every man colored until he is proved white."</MPQASENT>


                       <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To W. D. Howells, in Boston:

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I go to West Point with Twichell tomorrow, but shall be
back Tuesday or Wednesday; and then just as soon thereafter as you and
Mrs. Howells and Winny can come you will find us ready and most glad to
see you--and the longer you can stay the gladder we shall be.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am not
going to have a thing to do, but you shall work if you want to.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On the
evening of March 10th, I am going to read to the colored folk in the
African Church here (no whites admitted except such as I bring with me),
and a choir of colored folk will sing jubilee songs.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I count on a good
time, and shall hope to have you folks there, and Livy.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I read in
Twichell's chapel Friday night and had a most rattling high time--but the
thing that went best of all was Uncle Remus's Tar Baby.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I mean to try
that on my dusky audience.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They've all heard that tale from childhood--
at least the older members have.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I arrived home in time to make a most noble blunder--invited Charley
Warner here (in Livy's name) to dinner with the Gerhardts, and told him
Livy had invited his wife by letter and by word of mouth also.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I don't
know where I got these impressions, but I came home feeling as one does
who realizes that he has done a neat thing for once and left no flaws or
loop-holes.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Well, Livy said she had never told me to invite Charley and
she hadn't dreamed of inviting Susy, and moreover there wasn't any
dinner, but just one lean duck.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But Susy Warner's intuitions were
correct--so she choked off Charley, and staid home herself--we waited
dinner an hour and you ought to have seen that duck when he was done
drying in the oven.</MPQASENT>
                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">MARK.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Clemens and his wife were always privately assisting worthy and
     ambitious young people along the way of achievement.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Young actors
     were helped through dramatic schools; young men and women were
     assisted through college and to travel abroad.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Among others Clemens
     paid the way of two colored students, one through a Southern
     institution and another through the Yale law school.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The mention of the name of Gerhardt in the preceding letter
     introduces the most important, or at least the most extensive, of
     these benefactions.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The following letter gives the beginning of the
     story:


                       To W. D. Howells, in Boston:

Private and Confidential.</MPQASENT>
                                        <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">HARTFORD, Feb. 21, 1881.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">MY DEAR HOWELLS,--Well, here is our romance.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It happened in this way.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One morning, a month ago--no, three weeks--
Livy, and Clara Spaulding and I were at breakfast, at 10 A.M., and I was
in an irritable mood, for the barber was up stairs waiting and his hot
water getting cold, when the colored George returned from answering the
bell and said: "There's a lady in the drawing-room wants to see you."</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"A book agent!"</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">says I, with heat.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"I won't see her; I will die in my
tracks, first."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then I got up with a soul full of rage, and went in there and bent
scowling over that person, and began a succession of rude and raspy
questions--and without even offering to sit down.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not even the defendant's youth and beauty and (seeming) timidity were
able to modify my savagery, for a time--and meantime question and answer
were going on.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She had risen to her feet with the first question; and
there she stood, with her pretty face bent floorward whilst I inquired,
but always with her honest eyes looking me in the face when it came her
turn to answer.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And this was her tale, and her plea-diffidently stated, but straight-
forwardly; and bravely, and most winningly simply and earnestly: I put it
in my own fashion, for I do not remember her words:

Mr. Karl Gerhardt, who works in Pratt & Whitney's machine shops, has made
a statue in clay, and would I be so kind as to come and look at it, and
tell him if there is any promise in it?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He has none to go to, and he
would be so glad.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">"O, dear me," I said, "I don't know anything about art--there's nothing I
could tell him."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But she went on, just as earnestly and as simply as before, with her
plea--and so she did after repeated rebuffs; and dull as I am, even I
began by and by to admire this brave and gentle persistence, and to
perceive how her heart of hearts was in this thing, and how she couldn't
give it up, but must carry her point.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">So at last I wavered, and promised
in general terms that I would come down the first day that fell idle--and
as I conducted her to the door, I tamed more and more, and said I would
come during the very next week--"We shall be so glad--but--but, would you
please come early in the week?<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">--the statue is just finished and we are so
anxious--and--and--we did hope you could come this week--and"--well, I
came down another peg, and said I would come Monday, as sure as death;
and before I got to the dining room remorse was doing its work and I was
saying to myself, "Damnation, how can a man be such a hound?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">why didn't I
go with her now?"</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yes, and how mean I should have felt if I had known
that out of her poverty she had hired a hack and brought it along to
convey me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But luckily for what was left of my peace of mind, I didn't
know that.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Well, it appears that from here she went to Charley Warner's.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There was
a better light, there, and the eloquence of her face had a better chance
to do its office.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Warner fought, as I had done; and he was in the midst
of an article and very busy; but no matter, she won him completely.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He
laid aside his MS and said, "Come, let us go and see your father's
statue.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That is--is he your father?"</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"No, he is my husband."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So this
child was married, you see.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was a Saturday.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Next day Warner came to dinner and said "Go!<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">--go
tomorrow--don't fail."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was in love with the girl, and with her
husband too, and said he believed there was merit in the statue.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pretty
crude work, maybe, but merit in it.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Patrick and I hunted up the place, next day; the girl saw us driving up,
and flew down the stairs and received me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Her quarters were the second
story of a little wooden house--another family on the ground floor.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The
husband was at the machine shop, the wife kept no servant, she was there
alone.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">She had a little parlor, with a chair or two and a sofa; and the
artist-husband's hand was visible in a couple of plaster busts, one of
the wife, and another of a neighbor's child; visible also in a couple of
water colors of flowers and birds; an ambitious unfinished portrait of
his wife in oils: some paint decorations on the pine mantel; and an
excellent human ear, done in some plastic material at 16.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then we went into the kitchen, and the girl flew around, with enthusiasm,
and snatched rag after rag from a tall something in the corner, and
presently there stood the clay statue, life size--a graceful girlish
creature, nude to the waist, and holding up a single garment with one
hand the expression attempted being a modified scare--she was interrupted
when about to enter the bath.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then this young wife posed herself alongside the image and so remained
--a thing I didn't understand.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But presently I did--then I said:

"O, it's you!"</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"Yes," she said, "I was the model.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He has no model but me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have stood
for this many and many an hour--and you can't think how it does tire one!</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I don't mind it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He works all day at the shop; and then, nights and
Sundays he works on his statue as long as I can keep up."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">She got a big chisel, to use as a lever, and between us we managed to
twist the pedestal round and round, so as to afford a view of the statue
from all points.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Well, sir, it was perfectly charming, this girl's
innocence and purity---exhibiting her naked self, as it were, to a
stranger and alone, and never once dreaming that there was the slightest
indelicacy about the matter.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And so there wasn't; but it will be many
along day before I run across another woman who can do the like and show
no trace of self-consciousness.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Well, then we sat down, and I took a smoke, and she told me all about her
people in Massachusetts--her father is a physician and it is an old and
respectable family--(I am able to believe anything she says.)</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And she
told me how "Karl" is 26 years old; and how he has had passionate
longings all his life toward art, but has always been poor and obliged to
struggle for his daily bread; and how he felt sure that if he could only
have one or two lessons in--

"Lessons?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Hasn't he had any lessons?"</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He had never had a lesson.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And presently it was dinner time and "Karl" arrived--a slender young
fellow with a marvelous head and a noble eye--and he was as simple and
natural, and as beautiful in spirit as his wife was.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But she had to do
the talking--mainly--there was too much thought behind his cavernous eyes
for glib speech.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I went home enchanted.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Told Livy and Clara Spaulding all about the
paradise down yonder where those two enthusiasts are happy with a yearly
expense of $350.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Livy and Clara went there next day and came away
enchanted.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A few nights later the Gerhardts kept their promise and came
here for the evening.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was billiard night and I had company and so was
not down; but Livy and Clara became more charmed with these children than
ever.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Warner and I planned to get somebody to criticise the statue whose
judgment would be worth something.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So I laid for Champney, and after two
failures I captured him and took him around, and he said "this statue is
full of faults--but it has merits enough in it to make up for them"--
whereat the young wife danced around as delighted as a child.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we
came away, Champney said, "I did not want to say too much there, but the
truth is, it seems to me an extraordinary performance for an untrained
hand.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You ask if there is promise enough there to justify the Hartford
folk in going to an expense of training this young man.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I should say,
yes, decidedly; but still, to make everything safe, you had better get
the judgment of a sculptor."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Warner was in New York.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I wrote him, and he said he would fetch up Ward
--which he did.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Yesterday they went to the Gerhardts and spent two
hours, and Ward came away bewitched with those people and marveling at
the winning innocence of the young wife, who dropped naturally into
model-attitude beside the statue (which is stark naked from head to heel,
now--G. had removed the drapery, fearing Ward would think he was afraid
to try legs and hips) just as she has always done before.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Livy and I had two long talks with Ward yesterday evening.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He spoke
strongly.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He said, "if any stranger had told me that this apprentice did
not model that thing from plaster casts, I would not have believed it."</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He said "it is full of crudities, but it is full of genius, too.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is
such a statue as the man of average talent would achieve after two years
training in the schools.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And the boldness of the fellow, in going
straight to nature!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He is an apprentice--his work shows that, all over;
but the stuff is in him, sure.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hartford must send him to Paris--two
years; then if the promise holds good, keep him there three more--and
warn him to study, study, work, work, and keep his name out of the
papers, and neither ask for orders nor accept them when offered."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well, you see, that's all we wanted.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">After Ward was gone Livy came out
with the thing that was in her mind.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">She said, "Go privately and start
the Gerhardts off to Paris, and say nothing about it to any one else."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So I tramped down this morning in the snow-storm--and there was a
stirring time.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They will sail a week or ten days from now.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As I was starting out at the front door, with Gerhardt beside me and the
young wife dancing and jubilating behind, this latter cried out
impulsively, "Tell Mrs. Clemens I want to hug her--I want to hug you
both!"</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I gave them my old French book and they were going to tackle the
language, straight off.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now this letter is a secret--keep it quiet--I don't think Livy would mind
my telling you these things, but then she might, you know, for she is a
queer girl.</MPQASENT>
                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yrs ever,
                                        MARK.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Champney was J. Wells Champney, a portrait-painter of distinction;
     Ward was the sculptor, J. Q. A. Ward.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Gerhardts were presently off to Paris, well provided with means
     to make their dreams reality; in due time the letters will report
     them again.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The Uncle Remus tales of Joel Chandler Harris gave Mark Twain great
     pleasure.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He frequently read them aloud, not only at home but in
     public.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Finally, he wrote Harris, expressing his warm appreciation,
     and mentioning one of the negro stories of his own childhood, "The
     Golden Arm," which he urged Harris to look up and add to his
     collection.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">"You have pinned a proud feather in Uncle-Remus's cap," replied
     Harris.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">"I do not know what higher honor he could have than to
     appear before the Hartford public arm in arm with Mark Twain."</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He disclaimed any originality for the stories, adding, "I understand
     that my relations toward Uncle Remus are similar to those that exist
     between an almanac maker and the calendar."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He had not heard the
     "Golden Arm" story and asked for the outlines; also for some
     publishing advice, out of Mark Twain's long experience.</MPQASENT>


                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Joel Chandler Harris, in Atlanta:

                                             ELMIRA, N.Y., Aug. 10.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">MY DEAR MR. HARRIS,--You can argue yourself into the delusion that the
principle of life is in the stories themselves and not in their setting;
but you will save labor by stopping with that solitary convert, for he is
the only intelligent one you will bag.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In reality the stories are only
alligator pears--one merely eats them for the sake of the salad-dressing.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Uncle Remus is most deftly drawn, and is a lovable and delightful
creation; he, and the little boy, and their relations with each other,
are high and fine literature, and worthy to live, for their own sakes;
and certainly the stories are not to be credited with them.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But enough
of this; I seem to be proving to the man that made the multiplication
table that twice one are two.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I have been thinking, yesterday and to-day (plenty of chance to think, as
I am abed with lumbago at our little summering farm among the solitudes
of the Mountaintops,) and I have concluded that I can answer one of your
questions with full confidence--thus: Make it a subscription book.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Mighty few books that come strictly under the head of literature will
sell by subscription; but if Uncle Remus won't, the gift of prophecy has
departed out of me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When a book will sell by subscription, it will sell
two or three times as many copies as it would in the trade; and the
profit is bulkier because the retail price is greater.....

You didn't ask me for a subscription-publisher.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you had, I should
have recommended Osgood to you.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He inaugurates his subscription
department with my new book in the fall.....

Now the doctor has been here and tried to interrupt my yarn about "The
Golden Arm," but I've got through, anyway.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course I tell it in the negro dialect--that is necessary; but I have
not written it so, for I can't spell it in your matchless way.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is
marvelous the way you and Cable spell the negro and creole dialects.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Two grand features are lost in print: the weird wailing, the rising and
falling cadences of the wind, so easily mimicked with one's mouth; and
the impressive pauses and eloquent silences, and subdued utterances,
toward the end of the yarn (which chain the attention of the children
hand and foot, and they sit with parted lips and breathless, to be
wrenched limb from limb with the sudden and appalling "You got it").</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Old Uncle Dan'l, a slave of my uncle's' aged 60, used to tell us children
yarns every night by the kitchen fire (no other light;) and the last yarn
demanded, every night, was this one.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By this time there was but a
ghastly blaze or two flickering about the back-log.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">We would huddle
close about the old man, and begin to shudder with the first familiar
words; and under the spell of his impressive delivery we always fell a
prey to that climax at the end when the rigid black shape in the twilight
sprang at us with a shout.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When you come to glance at the tale you will recollect it--it is as
common and familiar as the Tar Baby.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Work up the atmosphere with your
customary skill and it will "go" in print.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Lumbago seems to make a body garrulous--but you'll forgive it.</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Truly yours

     The "Golden Arm" story was one that Clemens often used in his public
     readings, and was very effective as he gave it.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In his sketch, "How to Tell a Story," it appears about as he used to
     tell it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Harris, receiving the outlines of the old Missouri tale,
     presently announced that he had dug up its Georgia relative, an
     interesting variant, as we gather from Mark Twain's reply.</MPQASENT>


                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Joel Chandler Harris, in Atlanta:

                                             HARTFORD, '81.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">MY DEAR MR. HARRIS,--I was very sure you would run across that Story
somewhere, and am glad you have.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A Drummond light--no, I mean a Brush
light--is thrown upon the negro estimate of values by his willingness to
risk his soul and his mighty peace forever for the sake of a silver
sev'm-punce.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And this form of the story seems rather nearer the true
field-hand standard than that achieved by my Florida, Mo., negroes with
their sumptuous arm of solid gold.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I judge you haven't received my new book yet--however, you will in a day
or two.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Meantime you must not take it ill if I drop Osgood a hint about
your proposed story of slave life.....

When you come north I wish you would drop me a line and then follow it in
person and give me a day or two at our house in Hartford.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you will,
I will snatch Osgood down from Boston, and you won't have to go there at
all unless you want to.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Please to bear this strictly in mind, and don't
forget it.</MPQASENT>
                         <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Sincerely yours

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Charles Warren Stoddard, to whom the next letter is written, was one
     of the old California literary crowd, a graceful writer of verse and
     prose, never quite arriving at the success believed by his friends
     to be his due.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He was a gentle, irresponsible soul, well loved by
     all who knew him, and always, by one or another, provided against
     want.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The reader may remember that during Mark Twain's great
     lecture engagement in London, winter of 1873-74, Stoddard lived with
     him, acting as his secretary.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At a later period in his life he
     lived for several years with the great telephone magnate, Theodore
     N. Vail.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At the time of this letter, Stoddard had decided that in
     the warm light and comfort of the Sandwich Islands he could survive
     on his literary earnings.</MPQASENT>


           <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Charles Warren Stoddard, in the Sandwich Islands:

                                             HARTFORD, Oct. 26 '81.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">MY DEAR CHARLIE,--Now what have I ever done to you that you should not
only slide off to Heaven before you have earned a right to go, but must
add the gratuitous villainy of informing me of it?<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">.....

The house is full of carpenters and decorators; whereas, what we really
need here, is an incendiary.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If the house would only burn down, we would
pack up the cubs and fly to the isles of the blest, and shut ourselves up
in the healing solitudes of the crater of Haleakala and get a good rest;
for the mails do not intrude there, nor yet the telephone and the
telegraph.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And after resting, we would come down the mountain a piece
and board with a godly, breech-clouted native, and eat poi and dirt and
give thanks to whom all thanks belong, for these privileges, and never
house-keep any more.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think my wife would be twice as strong as she is, but for this wearing
and wearying slavery of house-keeping.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, she thinks she must
submit to it for the sake of the children; whereas, I have always had a
tenderness for parents too, so, for her sake and mine, I sigh for the
incendiary.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When the evening comes and the gas is lit and the wear and
tear of life ceases, we want to keep house always; but next morning we
wish, once more, that we were free and irresponsible boarders.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Work?<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">--one can't you know, to any purpose.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I don't really get anything
done worth speaking of, except during the three or four months that we
are away in the Summer.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I wish the Summer were seven years long.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I keep
three or four books on the stocks all the time, but I seldom add a
satisfactory chapter to one of them at home.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yes, and it is all because
my time is taken up with answering the letters of strangers.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It can't be
done through a short hand amanuensis--I've tried that--it wouldn't work
--I couldn't learn to dictate.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">What does possess strangers to write so
many letters?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I never could find that out.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">However, I suppose I did it
myself when I was a stranger.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But I will never do it again.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Maybe you think I am not happy?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">the very thing that gravels me is that I
am.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I don't want to be happy when I can't work; I am resolved that
hereafter I won't be.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What I have always longed for, was the privilege
of living forever away up on one of those mountains in the Sandwich
Islands overlooking the sea.</MPQASENT>
                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yours ever

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That magazine article of yours was mighty good: up to your very best I
think.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I enclose a book review written by Howells.</MPQASENT>


                       <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To W. D. Howells, in Boston:

                                             HARTFORD, Oct. 26 '81.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I am delighted with your review, and so is Mrs.
Clemens.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What you have said, there, will convince anybody that reads it;
a body cannot help being convinced by it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is the kind of a review
to have; the doubtful man; even the prejudiced man, is persuaded and
succumbs.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What a queer blunder that was, about the baronet.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I can't quite see how
I ever made it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">There was an opulent abundance of things I didn't know;
and consequently no need to trench upon the vest-pocketful of things I
did know, to get material for a blunder.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Charley Warren Stoddard has gone to the Sandwich Islands permanently.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Lucky devil.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is the only supremely delightful place on earth.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It
does seem that the more advantage a body doesn't earn, here, the more of
them God throws at his head.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This fellow's postal card has set the
vision of those gracious islands before my mind, again, with not a leaf
withered, nor a rainbow vanished, nor a sun-flash missing from the waves,
and now it will be months, I reckon, before I can drive it away again.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is beautiful company, but it makes one restless and dissatisfied.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With love and thanks,
                         Yrs ever,
                                   MARK.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The review mentioned in this letter was of The Prince and the
     Pauper.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What the queer" blunder" about the baronet was, the present
     writer confesses he does not know; but perhaps a careful reader
     could find it, at least in the early edition; very likely it was
     corrected without loss of time.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Clemens now and then found it necessary to pay a visit to Canada in
     the effort to protect his copyright.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He usually had a grand time on
     these trips, being lavishly entertained by the Canadian literary
     fraternity.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In November, 1881, he made one of these journeys in the
     interest of The Prince and the Pauper, this time with Osgood, who
     was now his publisher.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In letters written home we get a hint of his
     diversions.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Monsieur Frechette mentioned was a Canadian poet of
     considerable distinction.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"Clara" was Miss Clara Spaulding, of
     Elmira, who had accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Clemens to Europe in 1873,
     and again in 1878.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Later she became Mrs. John B. Staachfield, of
     New York City.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Her name has already appeared in these letters many
     times.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Livy darling, you and Clara ought to have been at breakfast in the great
dining room this morning.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">English female faces, distinctive English
costumes, strange and marvelous English gaits--and yet such honest,
honorable, clean-souled countenances, just as these English women almost
always have, you know.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Right away--

But they've come to take me to the top of Mount Royal, it being a cold,
dry, sunny, magnificent day.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Going in a sleigh.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Livy dear, a mouse kept me awake last night till 3 or 4 o'clock--so I am
lying abed this morning.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would not give sixpence to be out yonder in
the storm, although it is only snow.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">[The above paragraph is written in the form of a rebus illustrated with
various sketches.]</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There--that's for the children--was not sure that they could read
writing; especially jean, who is strangely ignorant in some things.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I can not only look out upon the beautiful snow-storm, past the vigorous
blaze of my fire; and upon the snow-veiled buildings which I have
sketched; and upon the churchward drifting umbrellas; and upon the
buffalo-clad cabmen stamping their feet and thrashing their arms on the
corner yonder: but I also look out upon the spot where the first white
men stood, in the neighborhood of four hundred years ago, admiring the
mighty stretch of leafy solitudes, and being admired and marveled at by
an eager multitude of naked savages.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The discoverer of this region, and
namer of it, Jacques Cartier, has a square named for him in the city.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I
wish you were here; you would enjoy your birthday, I think.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I hoped for a letter, and thought I had one when the mail was handed in,
a minute ago, but it was only that note from Sylvester Baxter.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You must
write--do you hear?<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">--or I will be remiss myself.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Livy darling, I received a letter from Monsieur Frechette this morning,
in which certain citizens of Montreal tendered me a public dinner next
Thursday, and by Osgood's advice I accepted it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would have accepted
anyway, and very cheerfully but for the delay of two days--for I was
purposing to go to Boston Tuesday and home Wednesday; whereas, now I go
to Boston Friday and home Saturday.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have to go by Boston on account of
business.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We drove about the steep hills and narrow, crooked streets of this old
town during three hours, yesterday, in a sleigh, in a driving snow-storm.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The people here don't mind snow; they were all out, plodding around on
their affairs--especially the children, who were wallowing around
everywhere, like snow images, and having a mighty good time.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I wish I
could describe the winter costume of the young girls, but I can't.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is
grave and simple, but graceful and pretty--the top of it is a brimless
fur cap.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Maybe it is the costume that makes pretty girls seem so
monotonously plenty here.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It was a kind of relief to strike a homely
face occasionally.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You descend into some of the streets by long, deep stairways; and in the
strong moonlight, last night, these were very picturesque.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I did wish
you were here to see these things.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You couldn't by any possibility sleep
in these beds, though, or enjoy the food.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Good night, sweetheart, and give my respects to the cubs.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It had been hoped that W. D. Howells would join the Canadian
     excursion, but Howells was not very well that autumn.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He wrote that
     he had been in bed five weeks, "most of the time recovering; so you
     see how bad I must have been to begin with.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">But now I am out of any
     first-class pain; I have a good appetite, and I am as abusive and
     peremptory as Guiteau."</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clemens, returning to Hartford, wrote him a
     letter that explains itself.</MPQASENT>


                       <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To W. D. Howells, in Boston:

                                             HARTFORD, Dec. 16 '81.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">MY DEAR HOWELLS,--It was a sharp disappointment--your inability to
connect, on the Canadian raid.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What a gaudy good time we should have
had!</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Disappointed, again, when I got back to Boston; for I was promising
myself half an hour's look at you, in Belmont; but your note to Osgood
showed that that could not be allowed out yet.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Atlantic arrived an hour ago, and your faultless and delicious Police
Report brought that blamed Joe Twichell powerfully before me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There's a
man who can tell such things himself (by word of mouth,) and has as sure
an eye for detecting a thing that is before his eyes, as any man in the
world, perhaps--then why in the nation doesn't he report himself with a
pen?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One of those drenching days last week, he slopped down town with his
cubs, and visited a poor little beggarly shed where were a dwarf, a fat
woman, and a giant of honest eight feet, on exhibition behind tawdry
show-canvases, but with nobody to exhibit to.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The giant had a broom, and
was cleaning up and fixing around, diligently.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Joe conceived the idea of
getting some talk out of him.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now that never would have occurred to me.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So he dropped in under the man's elbow, dogged him patiently around,
prodding him with questions and getting irritated snarls in return which
would have finished me early--but at last one of Joe's random shafts
drove the centre of that giant's sympathies somehow, and fetched him.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The fountains of his great deep were broken up, and he rained a flood of
personal history that was unspeakably entertaining.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Among other things it turned out that he had been a Turkish (native)
colonel, and had fought all through the Crimean war--and so, for the
first time, Joe got a picture of the Charge of the Six Hundred that made
him see the living spectacle, the flash of flag and tongue-flame, the
rolling smoke, and hear the booming of the guns; and for the first time
also, he heard the reasons for that wild charge delivered from the mouth
of a master, and realized that nobody had "blundered," but that a cold,
logical, military brain had perceived this one and sole way to win an
already lost battle, and so gave the command and did achieve the victory.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And mind you Joe was able to come up here, days afterwards, and reproduce
that giant's picturesque and admirable history.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But dern him, he can't
