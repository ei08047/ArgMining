     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It was August 13th when he reached San Francisco and wrote in his
     note-book, "Home again.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No--not home again--in prison again, and
     all the wild sense of freedom gone.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">City seems so cramped and so
     dreary with toil and care and business anxieties.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">God help me, I
     wish I were at sea again!"</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The transition from the dreamland of a becalmed sailing-vessel to
     the dull, cheerless realities of his old life, and the uncertainties
     of his future, depressed him--filled him with forebodings.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At one
     moment he felt himself on the verge of suicide--the world seemed so
     little worth while.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He wished to make a trip around the world, a project that required
     money.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He contemplated making a book of his island letters and
     experiences, and the acceptance by Harper's Magazine of the revised
     version of the Hornet Shipwreck story encouraged this thought.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Friends urged him to embody in a lecture the picturesque aspect of
     Hawaiian life.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The thought frightened him, but it also appealed to
     him strongly.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He believed he could entertain an audience, once he
     got started on the right track.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As Governor of the Third House at
     Carson City he had kept the audience in hand.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Men in whom he had
     the utmost confidence insisted that he follow up the lecture idea
     and engage the largest house in the city for his purpose.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The
     possibility of failure appalled him, but he finally agreed to the
     plan.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In Roughing It, and elsewhere, has been told the story of this
     venture--the tale of its splendid success.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He was no longer
     concerned, now, as to his immediate future.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The lecture field was
     profitable.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">His audience laughed and shouted.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He was learning the
     flavor of real success and exulting in it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">With Dennis McCarthy,
     formerly one of the partners in the Enterprise, as manager, he made
     a tour of California and Nevada.</MPQASENT>


              <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Jane Clemens and others, in St. Louis:

                                        VIRGINIA CITY, Nov. 1, 1866.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">ALL THE FOLKS, AFFECTIONATE GREETING,--You know the flush time's are
past, and it has long been impossible to more than half fill the Theatre
here, with any sort of attraction, but they filled it for me, night
before last--full--dollar all over the house.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I was mighty dubious about Carson, but the enclosed call and some
telegrams set that all right--I lecture there tomorrow night.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They offer a full house and no expense in Dayton--go there next.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sandy
Baldwin says I have made the most sweeping success of any man he knows
of.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have lectured in San Francisco, Sacramento, Marysville, Grass Valley,
Nevada, You Bet, Red Dog and Virginia.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am going to talk in Carson,
Gold Hill, Silver City, Dayton, Washoe, San Francisco again, and again
here if I have time to re-hash the lecture.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then I am bound for New York--lecture on the Steamer, maybe.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'll leave toward 1st December--but I'll telegraph you.</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Love to all.</MPQASENT>
                                             <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yrs.</MPQASENT>
                                                  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">MARK.</MPQASENT>


<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His lecture tour continued from October until December, a period of
picturesque incident, the story of which has been recorded elsewhere.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">--[See Mark Twain: A Biography, by the same author]--It paid him well;
he could go home now, without shame.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Indeed, from his next letter, full
of the boyish elation which always to his last years was the complement
of his success, we gather that he is going home with special honors--
introductions from ministers and the like to distinguished personages of
the East.</MPQASENT>


              <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:

                                             SAN F., Dec. 4, 1866.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">MY DEAR FOLKS,--I have written to Annie and Sammy and Katie some time
ago--also, to the balance of you.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I called on Rev. Dr. Wadsworth last night with the City College man,
but he wasn't at home.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I was sorry, because I wanted to make his
acquaintance.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am thick as thieves with the Rev. Stebbings, and I am
laying for the Rev. Scudder and the Rev. Dr. Stone.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am running on
preachers, now, altogether.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I find them gay.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stebbings is a regular
brick.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am taking letters of introduction to Henry Ward Beecher, Rev.
Dr. Tyng, and other eminent parsons in the east.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Whenever anybody offers
me a letter to a preacher, now I snaffle it on the spot.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I shall make
Rev. Dr. Bellows trot out the fast nags of the cloth for me when I get to
New York.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Bellows is an able, upright and eloquent man--a man of
imperial intellect and matchless power--he is Christian in the truest
sense of the term and is unquestionably a brick....

Gen. Drum has arrived in Philadelphia and established his head-quarters
there, as Adjutant Genl.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">to Maj. Gen. Meade.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Col. Leonard has received a
letter from him in which he offers me a complimentary benefit if I will
come there.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am much obliged, really, but I am afraid I shan't lecture
much in the States.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The China Mail Steamer is getting ready and everybody says I am throwing
away a fortune in not going in her.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I firmly believe it myself.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I sail for the States in the Opposition steamer of the 5th inst.,
positively and without reserve.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">My room is already secured for me, and
is the choicest in the ship.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I know all the officers.</MPQASENT>

                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yrs.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Affy
                                             MARK.</MPQASENT>


     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We get no hint of his plans, and perhaps he had none.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If his
     purpose was to lecture in the East, he was in no hurry to begin.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Arriving in New York, after an adventurous voyage, he met a number
     of old Californians--men who believed in him--and urged him to
     lecture.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He also received offers of newspaper engagements, and from
     Charles Henry Webb, who had published the Californian, which Bret
     Harte had edited, came the proposal to collect his published
     sketches, including the jumping Frog story, in book form.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Webb
     himself was in New York, and offered the sketches to several
     publishers, including Canton, who had once refused the Frog story by
     omitting it from Artemus Ward's book.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It seems curious that Canton
     should make a second mistake and refuse it again, but publishers
     were wary in those days, and even the newspaper success of the Frog
     story did not tempt him to venture it as the title tale of a book.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Webb finally declared he would publish the book himself, and
     Clemens, after a few weeks of New York, joined his mother and family
     in St. Louis and gave himself up to a considerable period of
     visiting, lecturing meantime in both Hannibal and Keokuk.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fate had great matters in preparation for him.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Quaker City
     Mediterranean excursion, the first great ocean picnic, was announced
     that spring, and Mark Twain realized that it offered a possible
     opportunity for him to see something of the world.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wrote at once
     to the proprietors of the Alta-California and proposed that they
     send him as their correspondent.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To his delight his proposition was
     accepted, the Alta agreeing to the twelve hundred dollars passage
     money, and twenty dollars each for letters.</MPQASENT>

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Quaker City was not to sail until the 8th of June, but the Alta
     wished some preliminary letters from New York.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, Webb
     had the Frog book in press, and would issue it May 1st.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Clemens,
     therefore, returned to New York in April, and now once more being
     urged by the Californians to lecture, he did not refuse.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Frank
     Fuller, formerly Governor of Utah, took the matter in hand and
     engaged Cooper Union for the venture.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He timed it for May 6th,
     which would be a few days after the appearance of Webb's book.</MPQASENT>
     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Clemens was even more frightened at the prospect of this lecture
     than he had been in San Francisco, and with more reason, for in New
     York his friends were not many, and competition for public favor was
     very great.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are two letters written May 1st, one to his
     people, and one to Bret Harte, in San Francisco; that give us the
     situation.</MPQASENT>

                     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To Bret Harte, in San Francisco:

                                   WESTMINSTER HOTEL, May 1, 1867.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">DEAR BRET,--I take my pen in hand to inform you that I am well and hope
these few lines will find you enjoying the same God's blessing.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The book is out, and is handsome.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is full of damnable errors of
grammar and deadly inconsistencies of spelling in the Frog sketch because
I was away and did not read the proofs; but be a friend and say nothing
about these things.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When my hurry is over, I will send you an autograph
copy to pisen the children with.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am to lecture in Cooper Institute next Monday night.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pray for me.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We sail for the Holy Land June 8.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Try to write me (to this hotel,) and
it will be forwarded to Paris, where we remain 10 or 15 days.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Regards and best wishes to Mrs. Bret and the family.</MPQASENT>

              <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:

                                   WESTMINSTER HOTEL, May 1, 1867.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">DEAR FOLKS,--Don't expect me to write for a while.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My hands are full of
business on account of my lecture for the 6th inst., and everything looks
shady, at least, if not dark.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have got a good agent--but now after we
have hired Cooper Institute and gone to an expense in one way or another
of $500, it comes out that I have got to play against Speaker Colfax at
Irving Hall, Ristori, and also the double troupe of Japanese jugglers,
the latter opening at the great Academy of Music--and with all this
against me I have taken the largest house in New York and cannot back
water.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let her slide!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If nobody else cares I don't.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'll send the book soon.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am awfully hurried now, but not worried.</MPQASENT>
                                   <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yrs.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Cooper Union lecture proved a failure, and a success.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When it became
evident to Fuller that the venture was not going to pay, he sent out a
flood of complimentaries to the school-teachers of New York City and the
surrounding districts.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No one seems to have declined them.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Clemens
lectured to a jammed house and acquired much reputation.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lecture
proposals came from several directions, but he could not accept them now.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He wrote home that he was eighteen Alta letters behind and had refused
everything.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Thos.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Nast, the cartoonist, then in his first fame, propped
a joint tour, Clemens to lecture while he, Nast, would illustrate with
"lightning" sketches; but even this could not be considered now.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In a
little while he would sail, and the days were overfull.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A letter written
a week before he sailed is full of the hurry and strain of these last
days.</MPQASENT>


              <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:

                         WESTMINSTER HOTEL, NEW YORK, June 1, 1867.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">DEAR FOLKS,--I know I ought to write oftener (just got your last,) and
more fully, but I cannot overcome my repugnance to telling what I am
doing or what I expect to do or propose to do.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then, what have I left to
write about?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Manifestly nothing.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It isn't any use for me to talk about the voyage, because I can have no
faith in that voyage till the ship is under way.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How do I know she will
ever sail?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">My passage is paid, and if the ship sails, I sail in her--but
I make no calculations, have bought no cigars, no sea-going clothing
--have made no preparation whatever--shall not pack my trunk till the
morning we sail.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet my hands are full of what I am going to do the day
before we sail--and what isn't done that day will go undone.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All I do know or feel, is, that I am wild with impatience to move--move
--move!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Half a dozen times I have wished I had sailed long ago in some
ship that wasn't going to keep me chained here to chafe for lagging ages
while she got ready to go.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Curse the endless delays!</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They always kill
me--they make me neglect every duty and then I have a conscience that
tears me like a wild beast.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I wish I never had to stop anywhere a month.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">I do more mean things, the moment I get a chance to fold my hands and sit
down than ever I can get forgiveness for.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yes, we are to meet at Mr. Beach's next Thursday night, and I suppose we
shall have to be gotten up regardless of expense, in swallow-tails, white
kids and everything en regle.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am resigned to Rev. Mr. Hutchinson's or anybody else's supervision.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I don't mind it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am fixed.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I have got a splendid, immoral, tobacco-
smoking, wine-drinking, godless room-mate who is as good and true and
right-minded a man as ever lived--a man whose blameless conduct and
example will always be an eloquent sermon to all who shall come within
their influence.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But send on the professional preachers--there are none
I like better to converse with.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If they're not narrow minded and bigoted
they make good companions.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I asked them to send the N. Y. Weekly to you--no charge.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am not going
to write for it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Like all other, papers that pay one splendidly it
circulates among stupid people and the 'canaille.'</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I have made no
arrangement with any New York paper--I will see about that Monday or
Tuesday.</MPQASENT>
                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Love to all

     <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is one more letter, written the night before the Quaker City

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DEAR FOLKS, I suppose we shall be many a league at sea tomorrow night,
and goodness knows I shall be unspeakably glad of it.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I haven't got anything to write, else I would write it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have just
written myself clear out in letters to the Alta, and I think they are the
stupidest letters that were ever written from New York.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Corresponding
has been a perfect drag ever since I got to the states.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If it continues

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have withdrawn the Sandwich Island book--it would be useless to publish
it in these dull publishing times.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As for the Frog book, I don't believe
that will ever pay anything worth a cent.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I published it simply to
advertise myself--not with the hope of making anything out of it.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Well, I haven't anything to write, except that I am tired of staying in
one place--that I am in a fever to get away.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Read my Alta letters--they
contain everything I could possibly write to you.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Tell Zeb and John
Leavenworth to write me.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They can get plenty of gossip from the pilots.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">An importing house sent two cases of exquisite champagne aboard the ship
for me today--Veuve Clicquot and Lac d'Or.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I and my room-mate have set
apart every Saturday as a solemn fast day, wherein we will entertain no
light matters of frivolous conversation, but only get drunk.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(That is a
joke.)</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">His mother and sisters are the best and most homelike people I
have yet found in a brown stone front.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is no style about them,
except in house and furniture.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I wish Orion were going on this voyage, for I believe he could not help
but be cheerful and jolly.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I often wonder if his law business is going
satisfactorily to him, but knowing that the dull season is setting in now
(it looked like it had already set in before) I have felt as if I could
almost answer the question myself--which is to say in plain words, I was
afraid to ask.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I wish I had gone to Washington in the winter instead of
going West.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I could have gouged an office out of Bill Stewart for him,
and that would atone for the loss of my home visit.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But I am so
worthless that it seems to me I never do anything or accomplish anything
that lingers in my mind as a pleasant memory.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">My mind is stored full of
unworthy conduct toward Orion and towards you all, and an accusing
conscience gives me peace only in excitement and restless moving from
place to place.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">If I could say I had done one thing for any of you that
entitled me to your good opinion, (I say nothing of your love, for I am
sure of that, no matter how unworthy of it I may make myself, from Orion
down you have always given me that, all the days of my life, when God
Almighty knows I seldom deserve it,) I believe I could go home and stay
there and I know I would care little for the world's praise or blame.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">satisfaction</MPQAPOL> in the world's <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">praise</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">anyhow</MPQAPOL>, and it has no
<MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">worth</MPQAPOL> to me save in the way of business.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">tried</MPQAPOL> to gather up its
compliments to send to you, but the work was <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">distasteful</MPQAPOL> and I dropped
it.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">You observe that under a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">cheerful</MPQAPOL> exterior I have got a <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">spirit</MPQAPOL> that is
<MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">angry</MPQAPOL> with me and gives me freely its <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">contempt</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I can get away from that
at sea, and be <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">tranquil</MPQAPOL> and satisfied-and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL>, with my parting <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">love</MPQAPOL> and
benediction for Orion and all of you, I say goodbye and God <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">bless</MPQAPOL> you
all--and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">welcome</MPQAPOL> the wind that wafts a <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">weary</MPQAPOL> soul to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">sunny</MPQAPOL> lands of
the Mediterranean!</MPQASENT>
                              <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Yrs.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Forever,
