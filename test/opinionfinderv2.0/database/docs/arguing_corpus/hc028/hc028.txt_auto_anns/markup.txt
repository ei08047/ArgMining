<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">More Obamacare insanity: Sebelius' shameless attempt to jawbone insurers on costs
ANDREA TANTAROS
 In early September, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius - throwing her new weight around after the passage of Obamacare - threatened the health insurance industry with a letter that spelled out "zero tolerance" for "unjustified rate increases."</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This week, her agency unveiled a new rule that allows the federal government to decide what counts as an "unreasonable" rate increase.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The upshot: If an insurance company increases the cost of a premium to above 10%, it may well feel the wrath of the feds.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There's just one problem: Under Obamacare, the federal government does not have the authority to block or overturn an insurance price increase.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(Congress debated whether or not to give the Health and Human Services Department this authority during the crafting of the legislation, but it was ultimately rejected.)</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In point of fact, 43 states already regulate and approve rates in the individual or small business market through their insurance commissioners.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This new law would let them continue to do their job - unless the federal government were to decide that their reviews weren't "effective."</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Once again, government is overreaching and telling private business what to do.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Stop for a moment and digest how silly all this is.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sebelius and her crew can scold insurance companies in public, but they have zero actual power to actually get a company to lower the objectionable cost.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's the politicization of price controls - big government at its strong-arming worst.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But there's a deeper problem here: The idea that our federal government, which is mandating that insurance companies to do more and more, can at the very same time be bullying by way of executive power to force them to charge less and less.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We often decry "unfunded mandates" when they hit states and local governments; why should we just roll our eyes when the target is private industry?</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The disconnect within the Obama administration either reveals how little it cares about the laws of economics or how convinced it is that it can single-handedly rewrite them.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">With the passage of Obamacare, the government slapped the managed care industry with a plethora of new must-do's: For example, requiring that the insurers cover young adults until they're 26  and banning them from denying coverage for anyone with preexisting conditions; mandating coverage of immunizations, and getting rid of lifetime limits.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">To add all these new requirements, then in the same breath to tell insurers that they cannot raise premiums, is like telling General Motors that the cars it produces need to have side air bags, hybrid engines and state-of-the-art sound systems, but they can't raise a single sticker price.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"The regulatory apparatus developing in the wake of the health reform law is leading to the politicization of the U.S. health care system," says Bill Smith, a former pharmaceutical executive and now a health care consultant with National Strategies in Washington, "and we have seen in the European context how political control of health care destroys innovation."</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So what does this mean for the insurance industry?</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Expect the market - which was already distorted in many ways - to get even more chaotic.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Besides the regulations creating a media frenzy for press-hungry politicians who can use insurers as a punching bag,  insurers will have to publicly justify why they are raising rates (through a statement on their website, for example).</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For a provider in a state like New York, a lashing from Washington could put pressure on our insurance commissioner to rein in any proposed increases.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The insurer could be pressured into keeping the rate low, which could in turn lead a New York-based insurer to pull out of the small-group or individual market, thus giving us fewer options.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">So while Sebelius' new rule gives her little new legal authority, it does give her the power to alter insurers' behavior through public shaming - a powerful political tool when anti-business sentiment is running so high.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And although insurers are required to cover certain benefits, they could diminish other, less essential ones, thus giving us, the patients, a watered-down product.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Plus, Obamacare was bad enough.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now, thousands of additional regulations are sprouting up in addition to the bill.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(Sebelius' new rule is 136 pages long - on top of a 2,000-plus page health care bill).</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But, under the Medical Loss Ratio rule in the Obamacare bill, insurers are not allowed to spend more on administrative costs.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So how are they supposed to read through this mountain of new mandates?</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The irony of it all is that Obamacare was supposed to provide coverage for everyone, and now it's squeezing the same industry that provides the coverage.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This puts our nation on the road to a public option, the left's ultimate goal.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">When premiums are squeezed but benefits are enriched, it is a recipe for insurers to withdraw from the market.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This could help politicians make the case for a government option in 2014, when the insurance exchanges go into effect.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Since an estimated 30 million people <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> be buying insurance through these exchanges, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">threat</MPQAPOL> is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">real</MPQAPOL> - and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">troublesome</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">So</MPQAPOL> while Obama and Sebelius tighten their grip, we, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">patients</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">stand</MPQAPOL> to pay the price.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It's <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enough</MPQAPOL> to make us <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sick</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
