stethoscope3Almost 1 million young adults are taking advantage of health care reform and staying on their parents’ health insurance plan.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is great news for supporters of health care reform and President Obama’s administration.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Expanding health insurance coverage to young adults was a goal of reform; unfortunately, young adults are more likely to go without health insurance more than any other age group.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To fix this issue, health care reform allows young adults to stay on their parents’ plan until they turn 26, regardless of whether they are in school or married.</MPQASENT>
