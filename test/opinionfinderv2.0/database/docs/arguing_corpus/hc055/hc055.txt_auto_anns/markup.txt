Just found out today that because of Obamacare, health insurance companies are no longer offering ‘child only’ policies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I wanted to switch my kids from their current health insurance, which is ‘child only’ to my own private policy, but it has to go through “underwriting” first.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In other words, let’s micro-analyze every sniffle and sneeze and tack on $100 a month per ounce of green snot over the last 5 years.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No wonder the insurance companies weren’t fighting this thing harder.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is a cash cow for them.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Furthermore, since doctor’s pay has been cut and cut and cut and full electronic record systems are far from universal use, doctors are now finding ways to cut their expenses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The new thing is to ask patients to get their own records and if you ask for them privately, they tack on a BS ‘copy’ expense.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To make matters worse, medical record departments are dragging their heals.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They have zero accountability and really don’t give a shit if you get your records tomorrow or three months from now.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you’re dying, they may just get another cup of coffee and extend their break time just to spite you.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">They make up HIPA laws as they go along just to make their job a little more interesting and they play lawyer on their down-time.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">(Of course, it’s not fair to paint all medical records clerks with the same brush, it’s just the last 20 that I’ve dealt with.)</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Furthermore, Medicare patients are now being booked on “Medicare” days.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I know this from taking my mother, a Medicare recipient, to various doctors over the last few months.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So doctors are now resorting to triple booking patients on the one day per week they have so graciously allowed Medicare patients to breathe their same air and be in the presence of their ginormous brains and mind blowing knowledge.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Medicare <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">patients</MPQAPOL> are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">forced</MPQAPOL> to wait for hours and hours and then the doctors spend 3 minutes with them and then pawn them off to the nurse, who tell the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">patients</MPQAPOL> that the doctor will answer their questions if they have time.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">So</MPQAPOL>, what part of Obamacare doesn’t suck?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Anyone?</MPQASENT>
