First Do No Harm: The President’s Cousin Explains Why His Hippocratic Oath Requires Him to Oppose ObamaCare

Milton R. Wolf, M.D.

HarperCollins (April 19, 2011)

Review by Peter Weiss, M.D.


For the past two years I have publicly debated the pros and cons of our health care system.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have debated against the implementation of ObamaCare — to no avail.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have been on too many health care panels to remember.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I have met with senators, congressmen, governors, and more.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The debates feel like the reenactment of the trench warfare of the First World War, with neither side making any headway in battle.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now comes First Do No Harm — a concise, clear delineation of ObamaCare and some possible health care solutions.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What makes this book — part of a new Tea Party series from HarperCollins — all the more intriguing is that it comes from President Obama’s cousin (okay, second cousin, once removed).</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dr. Milton Wolf likes to say that he is the “only Tea Partier the president knows.”</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Both Dr. Wolf and the president lost a parent at an early age — Dr. Wolf’s father from pancreatic cancer, the president’s mother from ovarian cancer.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(As an aside, my mother died from breast cancer when I was 16.)</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Interestingly, the president’s mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in Indonesia, yet she chose to come back to the USA for treatment — first at Sloan-Kettering in New York and later in Hawaii.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The president and Dr. Wolf took different lessons from their experiences.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dr. Wolf was grateful for having the best health care system in the world; the president lamented the costs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet even though Obama’s mother was not wealthy, she still received care at Sloan-Kettering, one of the best institutions in the world.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">First Do No Harm also reviews how government involved itself in health care from 1929 to 2003, with all well-meaning actions resulting in increasing costs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dr. Wolf astutely points out how health care became very political in the 1980s.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">State mandates “re-routed health care dollars not to the most necessary and innovative treatments, but instead to whomever had the best lobbyists.”</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This was the start of our current health care downfall.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Remember HillaryCare?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Dr. Wolf rightly has no kind words for President Bush either.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Medicare prescription coverage of 2003 was a political move to garner senior votes.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The bottom line of First Do No Harm is this: “At the very core of ObamaCare is a flawed belief that government can spend your money more effectively than you can yourself.”</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is an ideological divide between those in favor of the plan and those opposed.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I admire the Tea Party greatly.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Health care should not be a political line-item agenda — just as I can not tell a patient of mine what he or she must do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I can only give advice and recommendations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I can not force my patients to stop smoking or drinking, or to lose weight.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nor can President Obama mandate health.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To be fair, First Do No Harm does state that ObamaCare promises some nice things, such as no denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions, coverage for “children” up to age 26, and no lifetime limit on benefits.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These all sound great, and on paper they are.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I would also like the government to buy me a home, give me a car (nothing less than 6 cylinder), and put food on my table.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a Utopian world, we all live forever and will have world peace.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">One critical aspect of a good physician is being honest even when the news is bad.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Dr. Wolf is a good physician.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He gives a very strong argument against ObamaCare in a concise, easy-to-follow manner.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He offers some solutions, but still a lot more are needed to address the current situation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Those he does offer are well worth entertaining and are well thought out.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I, of course, like many other physicians, have solutions, too, some of which I have expressed in these pages before.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I equate Dr. Wolf with a good doctor who is able to explain to a patient and his or her family what is wrong.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He then takes the time to listen and gives his opinion as to what you should do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is a doctor you feel you can trust.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Under the Obama system, that doctor will be a thing of the past.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Your new physician will be spending half of his or her time doing data entry at point of service, checking off boxes on the state-mandated questionnaire before inputting the data to determine what medication the system will allow.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Never mind you only want to talk about your headaches.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most physicians take either the oath of Hippocrates or the oath of Maimonides.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">With these two time-honored oaths, we promise to be our individual patients’ champion and, above all, to do no harm.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under ObamaCare, the physician’s oath will be “to the health of the state” — and to the individual <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">patient</MPQAPOL> no longer.</MPQASENT>
