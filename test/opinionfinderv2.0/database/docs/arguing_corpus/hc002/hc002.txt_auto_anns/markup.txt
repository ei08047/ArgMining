						 A clever exit strategy for President Obama's health-care reform 

The only exit strategy for health-care reform will be the liberal dream of universal and guaranteed coverage - but without overt nationalization, writes columnist Charles Krauthammer.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It will be done through private insurance companies that, in reality, will be turned into government utilities.</MPQASENT>

WASHINGTON 
 Obamacare Version 1.0 is dead.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The 1,000-page monstrosity that emerged in various editions from Congress was done in by widespread national revulsion not just at its expense and intrusiveness but at the mendacity with which it is being sold.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">You don't need a Ph.D. to see that the promise to expand coverage and reduce costs is a crude deception, or that cutting $500 billion from Medicare without affecting care is a fiction.</MPQASENT> 
 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there is an exit strategy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And a politically clever one, if the Democrats are smart enough to seize it.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(1) 
 Forget the public option.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Whatever the merits, and they are few, it is political poison.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It dies by the Liasson Logic, the unassailable observation by NPR's Mara Liasson that there are no liberal Democrats who will lose their seats if the public option is left out, while there are many moderate Democrats who could lose their seats if the public option is included.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(2)
 Jettison any reference to end-of-life counseling.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People see (correctly) such Medicare-paid advice as subtle encouragement to voluntarily refuse treatment.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">People don't want government involvement in a process they consider the private province of patient, family and doctor.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Senate is already dropping it.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The House must follow.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(3) 
 Soft-pedal the idea of government committees determining "best practices."</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">President Obama's Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research was sold as simply government helping doctors choose the best treatments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But there are dozens of medical journal review articles that do just that.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The real purpose of FCCCERs is ultimately to establish official criteria for denying reimbursement to less favored (because presumably less effective) treatments 
- precisely the triage done by the NICE committee in Britain, the Orwellian body that once blocked access to a certain expensive anti-blindness drug until you went blind in one eye.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(4)
More generally, abandon the whole idea of Obamacare as cost-cutting.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">True, it was Obama's original rationale for creating a whole new entitlement at a time of a sinking economy and a bankrupt Treasury.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But, as many universal-health-care liberals complain, selling pain is poor salesmanship.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(5) 
Promise nothing but pleasure - for now.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Make health insurance universal and permanently protected.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Tear up the existing bills and write a clean one - Obamacare 2.0 - promulgating draconian health-insurance regulation that prohibits (a) denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, (b) dropping coverage if the client gets sick, and (c) capping insurance company reimbursement.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What's not to like?</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If you have insurance, you'll never lose it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nor will your children ever be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The regulated insurance companies will get two things in return.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Government will impose an individual mandate that will force the purchase of health insurance on the millions of healthy young people who today forgo it.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And government will subsidize all the others who are too poor to buy health insurance.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The result?</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Two enormous new revenue streams created by government for the insurance companies.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And here's what makes it so politically seductive: The end result is the liberal dream of universal and guaranteed coverage - but without overt nationalization.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is all done through private insurance companies.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Ostensibly private.</MPQASENT> 

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They will, in reality, have been turned into government utilities.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No longer able to control whom they can enroll, whom they can drop and how much they can limit their own liability, they will live off government largesse - subsidized premiums from the poor; forced premiums from the young and healthy.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's the perfect finesse - government health care by proxy.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">And because it's proxy, and because it will guarantee access to (supposedly) private health insurance - something that enjoys considerable Republican support - it will pass with wide bipartisan backing and give Obama a resounding political victory.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Isn't there a catch?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of course, there is.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This scheme is the ultimate bait-and-switch.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The pleasure comes now, the pain later.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Government-subsidized universal and virtually unlimited coverage will vastly compound already out-of-control government spending on health care.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The financial and budgetary consequences will be catastrophic.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, they will not appear immediately.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And when they do, the only solution will be rationing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That's when the liberals will give the FCCCER regulatory power and give you end-of-life counseling.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But by then, resistance will be feeble.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why?</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Because at that point the only remaining option will be to give up the benefits we will have become accustomed to.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Once granted, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">guaranteed</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">universal</MPQAPOL> health care is not relinquished.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Look</MPQAPOL> at Canada.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Look</MPQAPOL> at Britain.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They got hooked; now they ration.</MPQASENT>
