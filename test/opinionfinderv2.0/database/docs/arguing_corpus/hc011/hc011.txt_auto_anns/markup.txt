 We "have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it," proclaimed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the end of last spring's congressional health care debate.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Indeed, Americans are rapidly witnessing just how much an ever-expanding federal government is siphoning away states' power and saddling them with new costs.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A first glimpse was seen with communications firm AT&T's $1 billion write down against earnings thanks to the tax changes buried in the new 2,300-page health care law.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Heritage Foundation calculates that is a full third of AT&T's $3 billion earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other write downs have occurred, and a major reason involves the new tax treatment of prescription drug benefits for retirees.</MPQASENT> 

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Companies that currently deduct part of their costs for providing these benefits to retirees will no longer be able to do so.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Roland McDevitt, director of health research at Towers Watson, estimates that just this tax change alone eliminates $14 billion in U.S. corporate profits.</MPQASENT> 

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At a time when the national jobless rate hovers at almost 10 percent, this wholesale destruction of wealth and capital is a national tragedy toward unemployment.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">ObamaCare not only limits doctor-patient choice, it will -- if not reversed -- eventually force private insurance companies out of business and put everyone under a government-run system.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An Aug. 5 Wall Street Journal editorial warns, "ObamaCare mandates that insurers spend a certain percentage of premium dollars on benefits, but Democrats never got around to writing the fine print of what counts as a benefit.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So, a handful of regulators are now choosing among the tens of thousands of services that doctors, hospitals and insurers offer.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Few government decisions will do more to shape tomorrow's health market, or what's left of it."</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What will the government's final regulations be when they are issued this fall?</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Will the bureaucrats decide on a narrow definition of medical expenses?</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The insurance industry hopes not, and is rightfully lobbying for a less rigid standard.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After all, as the Journal notes, it will be easier to run a business and turn a profit if more of the costs are considered truly medical in nature.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Critics were right to ask how President Obama and proponents said they wouldn't raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year, yet their bill included $20 billion in new taxes on medical devices (along with the aforementioned new costs regarding prescription drugs).</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Even the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office warns that these taxes will be passed along to patients.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Medicaid program, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum notes, could soon be eating up 36 percent of his state's budget -- and that's before ObamaCare's new costs kick in.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Federal health, educational, environmental and labor mandates are chipping away at the states' ability to keep their taxes low, to expand jobs and to target money for their own priorities.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So it is no wonder McCollum's counterparts in 19 other hard-pressed states joined him to file a constitutional lawsuit to get out of Obamacare.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(It is also no wonder that more than 70 percent of the Missouri residents who turned out at the polls recently voted to annul the "individual mandate" within state lines -- the ObamaCare requirement that everyone buy insurance or else pay a tax.)</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">"The brazen nature of this administration is undermining the basic rule of law, the confidence of the public, and taking away states' authority -- creating an ever stronger federal government.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">My role is to make clear we're not going to put up with this," says McCollum about the lawsuit.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">President Obama and the Democrats controlling Congress still refuse to admit that their budget-busting legislation, bullied through on a party-line vote, doesn't "lower costs."</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The president has been less than forthcoming because he never admitted that his real goal is the imposition of federal power over everything from doctors to health insurance.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The CBO confirmed the dishonesty when it concluded the other day that the new bureaucracy the health care legislation creates is so complex and indiscriminate that its size and cost is "currently unknowable."</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Incredible.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">The defunding of this new health care bill by a new Congress next year, as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> as driving a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">stake</MPQAPOL> through its heart by its eventual rollback, cannot come fast <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enough</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">J.C. Watts (JCWatts01@jcwatts.com) is chairman of J.C. Watts Companies, a business consulting group.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He is former chairman of the Republican Conference of the U.S. House, where he served as an Oklahoma representative from 1995 to 2002.</MPQASENT>
