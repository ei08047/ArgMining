During the health care fight, President Obama and top Democrats argued that once people found out what was in their law, it would continue to gain support.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But as we approach the two year anniversary, a new AP poll finds support for Obama's signature legislative accomplishment has hit 29 percent, with 49 percent opposing it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That's the lowest level of support since the AP began polling the issue as it was moving through Congress in Sept. 2009.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Especially troubling for Democrats heading into an election year, is that the passion is also on the side of the opponents of the law.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just 13 percent consider themselves strong supporters, compared to 33 percent who say they "strongly oppose" the law.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even worse for Obama, just 15 percent of people said they think government should have the power to require individuals to purchase health insurance, compared to 84 percent who say they should not.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's a question the U.S. Supreme Court will resolve next year.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">(Pollsters asked: "Do you <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> the Federal Government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> have the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">power</MPQAPOL> to require all Americans to buy health insurance, and to pay a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fine</MPQAPOL> if they donâ€™t or do you <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">think</MPQAPOL> the Federal Government <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> not have that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">power</MPQAPOL>?")</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The one silver lining for Obama?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The two leading contenders for the Republican nomination, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, have <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">endorsed</MPQAPOL> the individual mandate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And as governor of Massachusetts, Romney signed a health care law that served as the model for Obama's national legislation.</MPQASENT>
