    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, I recently learned there are tax credits in the new healthcare law specifically for small businesses that will help us pocket some extra cash.</MPQASENT>

    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In Michigan, 85.1 percent, or 126,300 small businesses were eligible for a credit in 2010; 39,600 small businesses qualified for the maximum tax credit that year.</MPQASENT>
