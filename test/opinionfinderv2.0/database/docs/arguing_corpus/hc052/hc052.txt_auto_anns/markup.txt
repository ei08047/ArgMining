The biggest, best, and only necessary reason to oppose Obamacare

HEADNOTE: Yes, I'm going to call it "Obamacare," rather than the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which is a mouthful and doesn't produce a good acronym.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I should also disclose that I sometimes used to refer to the Strategic Defense Initiative as "Star Wars."</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If either of these things offends you, you can flick me right under the nose the next time you see me in public.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That can be very painful.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">***

There are many, many things to dislike about Obamacare in terms of both the substance of the law and the process by which it was passed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">For all of its flaws, though, I still haven't heard a single Republican presidential candidate make this case against it:

Every government, every business, every family, and every individual knows that you're supposed to pay for necessities before you buy luxuries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You take care of your needs first--things like food, shelter, clothing, and transportation--before you start buying big screen TVs and Hawaiian vacations.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is just common sense, good financial practice, and the only form of responsible budgeting and spending over the long haul.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In this country, for the better part of the last 40 years--but especially in the last three years, and continuing as far into the future as we can reasonably project--we cannot pay for the things we all agree we need: national defense, health care and income support for seniors, a safety net for the poor, veterans' benefits, and so on.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These are necessities for which we are currently borrowing 40 cents of every dollar.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">When we aren't able to pay for these necessities, how can we possibly contemplate a new, permanent entitlement that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Why are we planning a Hawaiian vacation when we can't afford to pay our mortgage, clothe our children, or buy groceries?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Why are we taking on a massive new commitment when we can't honor our existing commitments?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The only rational way forward is to address our current and future budget crisis--find a way to pay for the obligations we have under existing law--before taking on a new set of obligations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">When we get to the point that our budgets are balanced and are projected to stay that way for the foreseeable future, then--and only then--should we begin thinking about the "luxuries" we might be able to afford.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I realize that some of you will say "Health care for all is not a luxury; it's a necessity."</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That's fine.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But that opinion comes with an obligation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The obligation is to show how we will pay for our newly expanded list of essential government functions.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The president hasn't done that...hasn't even pretended to care much about doing it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Democratic Senate hasn't done that...hasn't, in fact, passed a budget in years.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Democratic House didn't do it when it had the chance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In short, all the Democrats have done with Obamacare is take an acute problem--our budget crisis--and make it nearly terminal.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">That's horrifically irresponsible public policy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's also a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">threat</MPQAPOL> to the American economy, the American way of life, and the American way of government.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That's why my first priority, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> I become president, will be to repeal Obamacare.</MPQASENT>
