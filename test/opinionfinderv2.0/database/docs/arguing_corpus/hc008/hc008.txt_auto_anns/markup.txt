							By Michael R. McGarvey 
 It's high time for people who know something to speak up.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Six months ago today, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, the most ambitious and far-reaching reform of the health-care system in 45 years.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">In the months since that historic accomplishment, the public has been subjected to a relentless barrage of know-nothing, self-interested negativism from politicians and interest groups funded by the insurance industry, and the polls show voters are taking it seriously.</MPQASENT>  
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In the run-up to the reform vote, House Minority Leader John Boehner repeatedly crowed that the U.S. health-care system is "the best in the world."</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That is simply false.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">On every measure used to assess the effectiveness of health-care systems, the United States is outranked by more than 30 other nations.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The first step to improvement is to recognize the problems.</MPQASENT>  
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">I am a physician, and I spent 16 years of my career in and around the health-insurance industry, and I think the health-reform law is a huge step in the right direction.</MPQASENT>  

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let's consider what the law has already accomplished: Roughly four million Medicare beneficiaries who have hit the "doughnut hole" in their drug coverage are getting $250 rebates this year, along with a 50 percent discount on prescription drugs; a temporary reinsurance program was established to protect early retirees; and a temporary high-risk insurance pool was created to help Americans who are uninsured because of preexisting conditions.</MPQASENT>  
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Beginning today, a number of key provisions go into effect: 
 No health plan will be able to continue the practice of dropping a person who gets sick; lifetime caps on coverage will be prohibited; annual coverage limits in many plans will be tightly restricted; most health-insurance plans will be prohibited from denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions; young people up to their 26th birthday will be able to remain on their parents' insurance policies; and new plans will be required to cover preventive services without imposing co-payments or deductibles.</MPQASENT>  
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wisely, the authors of this extensive health-reform law phased its implementation over four years.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By the time the bill is fully implemented in 2014, health-insurance exchanges will be in place throughout the nation to test whether the private insurance industry can satisfy the needs of the public.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At that time, no adults with preexisting conditions can be discriminated against by health insurers; women will no longer be subjected to higher premiums than men; the nation will be investing in improving the supply of primary-care doctors and nurses; and community health centers will be receiving additional support.</MPQASENT>  
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At the same time, progress will have been made in ensuring that tests and treatments proven to work are being applied to patients.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Most important, some 32 million previously uninsured Americans will enjoy the physical and psychological benefits of knowing they have health insurance.</MPQASENT>  

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A core principle of the discipline of operations research is that a successful solution has to be at least as complex as the problem.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The health-reform law is certainly complex, but so is the so-called U.S. health-care system.</MPQASENT>  
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Few pieces of legislation prove to be perfect on enactment, and our world is constantly changing.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There will be changes we wish to make as implementation unfolds, and these can be accomplished.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The law offers all of us the opportunity to put our shoulders to the wheel to ensure successful implementation and identify areas for improvement.</MPQASENT>  
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The current clamor for repeal is a fool's mission.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Let's <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">hope</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">such</MPQAPOL> talk dies a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">natural</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">death</MPQAPOL> as the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">benefits</MPQAPOL> of the law become more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">concrete</MPQAPOL>, beginning today.</MPQASENT>
