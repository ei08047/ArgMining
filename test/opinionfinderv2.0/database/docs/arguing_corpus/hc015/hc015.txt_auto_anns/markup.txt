By ALLYSON SCHWARTZ
 ON SEPT. 23, families in Northeast Philadelphia and across the country began to see firsthand the benefits of the new health-care reform law.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Together, we can celebrate these changes and know that, starting now, we will put an end to some of the most egregious insurance-company practices that have kept you and your family from being in control of your health care.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many of these important reforms are already under way.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Pennsylvania now has a high-risk insurance option, called FairCare, which offers coverage for people who were previously denied it because of a pre-existing condition.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Seniors who reach the prescription drug "doughnut hole" are receiving $250 checks in the mail to help them afford their medications.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Early retirees are benefiting from a program that helps their employers maintain their health coverage.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And 4 million small businesses are eligible to receive tax credits to better enable them to provide coverage to their employees.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just last week, even more changes went into effect.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Because of new consumer protections, families will have better coverage, lower costs and more secure coverage.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">One of the most frightening ordeals a family can face is a seriously ill child.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">As a parent, I know parents need to focus on getting their child the care they need, rather than whether their insurance policy will cover essential treatment.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For far too long, insurance companies have denied coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, adding concerns and costs for families.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This has been a commonplace practice in the insurance industry that ends now.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">IT'S NOW the law that no child can be denied insurance coverage because of a pre-existing condition, something I championed throughout the reform process.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Besides this important reform, there are other new rules for insurers.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They will be prohibited from dropping coverage when people get sick, and all family policies must allow young adults to remain on their parents' coverage until their 26th birthday, bridging the gap that often occurs between school and the workplace.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Other new reforms will improve the quality of insurance and prevent consumers from getting stuck with medical bills.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">* All insurance plans are prohibited from imposing lifetime limits on coverage - so people with costly diseases won't see their coverage evaporate when they are most ill.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">* All employer plans and new individual plans are restricted from setting annual limits on coverage.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">* All new plans must have an effective internal and external appeals process, so if you want to appeal a decision your insurer makes, the appeal isn't lost in corporate bureaucracy.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Over the next several years, this new law will continue to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reform</MPQAPOL> the health-insurance marketplace - creating health-insurance exchanges where consumers can comparison shop for coverage; requiring insurers to use more of your premium dollars on medical care instead of administrative costs and CEO salaries; offering tax credits to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL> working families <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">afford</MPQAPOL> coverage; and strengthening Medicare for seniors.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reforms</MPQAPOL> will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">improve</MPQAPOL> the coverage people get through their employers and the individual health insurance policies they buy from insurers.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">BUT BE <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">aware</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">opponents</MPQAPOL> of health-care <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reform</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">like</MPQAPOL> to repeal the law and take away these <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">important</MPQAPOL> consumer <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">protections</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">proud</MPQAPOL> that these <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reforms</MPQAPOL> are a reality and making a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">difference</MPQAPOL> in people's lives today.</MPQASENT>
