This week, House Republicans will move forward with their efforts to pass HR 2, the “Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act” which effectively repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, aka health care reform.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">HR 2, expected to pass the House by a wide-margin, is dead on arrival in the Democratically-controlled Senate and would never be signed into law by the President.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">So the question is – to what end?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The move to undo the Affordable Health Care Act makes for great political theater and is a hunk of red meat to the Tea Party.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It will also certainly be considered by the Beltway insiders and cable television pundits to be a political win for Republicans.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, will this symbolic vote actually force the Republicans to defend what repealing the Affordable Health Care Act means for the county?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No one can be sure.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">What we do know is that if actual repeal did in fact happen, the following is what it would mean for the American people.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">First, budget deficits will increase, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Republicans found a renewed concern for the federal budget deficit the day President Obama took office and have charged that the country cannot afford to ensure that all Americans have health insurance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">However, the CBO found that HR 2 will actually increase budget deficits approximately $230 billion by 2021.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) dismissed the CBO estimate saying that “I do not believe that repealing the job- killing health care law will increase the deficit.”</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Second, popular provisions already in effect would be undone.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A number of provisions that are currently in effect are:

• Young people can stay on their parent’s health insurance plan until age 26.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">• Preventative care such as vaccines, mammograms, blood pressure screenings, pap tests, colonoscopies among others are free, i.e. no longer subject to co-pays or deductibles.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">• Health insurance companies can no longer deny children coverage because of a pre-existing condition.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">• Health insurance companies can no longer kick someone off their insurance plan if they get sick.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">• Seniors who reach the Medicare Part D donut hole are eligible for a 50% discount on all prescription drugs.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">• Preventative health care for seniors such as annual wellness exams are free.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">• Health insurance companies can no longer put a cap on how much they will pay in medical care for a person over his or her lifetime.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">• Health insurance companies can no longer charge women more for their health insurance than they do men.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">• Small businesses are eligible for tax credits if they offer health insurance coverage to their employees [80 percent of California’s small businesses are eligible.]</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">• People who have been denied health insurance for having a pre-existing condition can now purchase health insurance from the Pre-Existing Condition Health Plan.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">• For health insurers, 85% of employee plans’ premiums and 80% of individual plans’ premiums must be spent on medical care as compared to health insurance companies’ administrative costs, including CEO salaries.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And, beginning in 2014:

• Health insurance companies can no longer deny a person health insurance because of a pre-existing condition.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">• All uninsured people will be able to purchase private health insurance from their state’s health insurance exchange – a pool of private insurance plans available for purchase.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">[California was the first state to set up its exchange]

• Increase the small business tax credit for offering health insurance to their employees.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Finally, any repeal would leave millions uninsured.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The CBO report also estimated that the repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act will leave 54 million nonelderly people uninsured.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yet, the Republicans have not offered an alternative plan to cover any of these people.</MPQASENT>
