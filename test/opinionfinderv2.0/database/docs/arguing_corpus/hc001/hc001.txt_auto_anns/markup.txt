 Health reform: Down the stretch it comes.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">President Obama has gone so far as to postpone an overseas trip in a last-ditch push to get a comprehensive reform bill to his desk.</MPQASENT>
 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He shouldn't waste his energy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not with unemployment justifiably the nation's top concern and the possibility of a double-dip recession still looming.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Remember how Obama said, in his State of the Union reboot, "Jobs must be our No. 1 focus in 2010"?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Well, apparently he doesn't.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not with the American people abandoning the President's prescription in huge numbers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Just one in four voters supports the reform bill as written; half want Congress to start over.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Compare that with the popular support other major pieces of social legislation enjoyed before passage, like welfare reform (68%), Medicare (63%) and civil rights (60%).</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not with health care costs having risen 73% over the last decade - with Medicaid growing at 21% a year - and showing no signs of coming down to Earth.</MPQASENT> 
 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Controlling costs is the absolute, unconditional, a-blind-man-could-see-it prerequisite for expanding coverage.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not with American health care quality actually quite impressive in many respects, including world-leading rates for patients surviving cancer and among the shortest wait times for hard-to-find treatments and surgeries.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not with a half-dozen accounting gimmicks built into the legislation - including the fact that federal budget projections are based on 10 years worth of tax collections and just six years of spending increases.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not with the Senate, lacking even a single Republican vote, having to resort to reconciliation, a little-used parliamentary maneuver, to get it through.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Sure, it's been used before - but not on anything that has such limited public support.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Not after all the cynical back room deals - deals Obama has committed to removing - having frayed the public trust.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">With legislation of this magnitude, that is not a renewable resource.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obama clearly thought he was doing the right and necessary and bold thing by tackling health reform.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">His conviction has been admirable.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But reality has come a-knocking, quite persistently, and it's saying: Enough already.</MPQASENT> 
 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fix what's broken, then move on.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He should assemble a modest consensus package of two or three smart ideas, such as outlawing insurance company abuses - like discrimination based on preexisting conditions - speeding the adoption of electronic medical records and reining in the medical malpractice market.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Only a targeted approach will begin to tackle the central problem plaguing American health care, which is how terribly much it all costs.</MPQASENT> 

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And only a targeted approach will carry the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">promise</MPQAPOL> of bipartisan action that will not set off a new <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">civil</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">war</MPQAPOL> in Washington.</MPQASENT> 
 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And it will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">enable</MPQAPOL> Obama and the Democrats - who run Washington - to get back to creating jobs.</MPQASENT> 	<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Which happens to be the <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">best</MPQAPOL> way for them to keep their own jobs <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">secure</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
