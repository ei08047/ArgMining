Why Doctors Will Support ObamaCare Repeal
Hadley Heath

This week the Republican members of the House of Representatives plan to vote to repeal the new health care law known as "ObamaCare."</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Democrats are quickly dismissing the effort.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pledged to block the bill and Rep. Pete Stark (D-CA) tarred it as nothing more than "an obvious attempt to throw red meat to extreme Tea Partiers in the Republican base."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Democrats may wish that only a fringe of hard line, anti-government types supported repealing ObamaCare, but the truth is very different.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Support for ObamaCare's repeal is broad, and includes one group too often overlooked during the health care debate: America's doctors.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">According to a Physicians Foundation survey from November, 56 percent of doctors said the new law will diminish the quality of care they can provide to patients.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One under-discussed outcome of Obamacare may be a growing shortage of accessible doctors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many doctors expressed their intention to retire early, close their practices, or exit the profession entirely after the law passed.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">While more current doctors turn in their stethoscopes, fewer smart kids will enter medicine, which will compound America's already predicted doctor shortage, even as Medicaid rolls grow longer.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Association of American Medical Colleges projects that nationwide physician shortages will balloon to 62,900 doctors in five years and 91,500 by 2020.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Common sense tells us that we can't treat more patients in the U.S. health care system with fewer doctors per patient.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That's a basic problem of supply and demand, a concept often ignored by those crafting the legislation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That wasn't the only information disregarded during the health care debate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Legislators also snubbed the policy recommendations of practicing physicians: Fully eighty-six percent of doctors surveyed said the viewpoint of physicians was not adequately represented in the passage of the reform.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maybe our policymakers thought it was alright to ignore doctors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">After all, ObamaCare is supposed to be all about the patient, giving them more access to treatment (even if it does so by forcing them to buy insurance).</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yet attracting and retaining doctors is critical to the health of our medical system and to serving patients' needs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many Americans may assume that relatively high pay will be enough to keep doctors in the profession.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But doctors' "high pay" should be kept in perspective: Medical doctors go for years without any pay while in medical school (which is expensive).</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">During residency, they must work long, undesirable hours.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Then they enter the profession, and because of today's messy tort system, they must pay for pricy malpractice insurance, which eats into their earnings.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">These highly intelligent individuals have many other ways to earn money outside of the medical field, and will opt to do so if medicine becomes a less attractive option.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Doctors' opposition to ObamaCare is likely as much due to what the legislation didn't do, as it is to what it did wrong.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">ObamaCare didn't reform tort law, which contributes to the high cost of health care by driving defensive medicine and keeping malpractice premiums high for doctors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It didn't fix the Sustainable Growth Rate formula, which determines how much Medicare pays for services physicians provide.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In fact, ObamaCare intentionally left the so-called "doc fix" out because it would have added to the bill's costs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But cuts to Medicare reimbursements are still scheduled each year, and doctors will have to wait on Congress to determine how much they will or won't be paid to see their elderly patients.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition to ignoring some existing problems in the health care system, ObamaCare will actually worsen other problems for doctors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">ObamaCare will add 18 million people to Medicaid, which on average reimburses doctors only 56 percent of the market rate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sixty percent of doctors are already considering a move to stop accepting government health programs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is bad news for patients who were promised "easy access," but it's hard on doctors as well, who entered the profession to help the sick, not to have to turn them away.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">ObamaCare also inserts an unprecedented amount of government bureaucracy into the work that doctors do.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">You've probably already seen the ObamaCare flow chart with a thousand arrows.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Where do you think doctors fit into that mess?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here are a few places: The Physician Quality Reporting Program means (even) more paperwork for doctors.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Independent Payment Advisory Board will attempt to reduce government spending on Medicare, essentially through price controls.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This will make it more difficult for Medicare patients and their doctors to access the right treatments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The "non-profit" Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute will gather information on comparative effectiveness in patient outcomes, which may ultimately dictate which treatments doctors must prescribe.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It's unknown just how much doctors' choices will be limited, but doctors naturally fear their loss of autonomy.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So next time you visit your family physician, or your optometrist, or your neurosurgeon, ask how he or she feels about the health reform.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ask if he or she favors repeal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In most cases, the answer will be yes.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Congress <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL>n't <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">ignore</MPQAPOL> input from doctors on health policy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Repeal is the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">right</MPQAPOL> prescription.</MPQASENT>
