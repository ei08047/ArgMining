N.M. Should Join Suits Against ObamaCare 

By Thomas Molitor
Adjunct scholar, Rio Grande Foundation
 Our next governor has a huge plate of problems to deal with on Day One of her administration starting next month, and I would have preferred to lessen her decision load, but unfortunately, I'm afraid I'm going to pile on one more - ObamaCare.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Twenty states have joined in an amended federal lawsuit against the Reid/Pelosi/Obama nationalized health care plan.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Granted, my doctor is kind of a career curmudgeon, so it didn't surprise me a bit last week when I was in his office for a routine checkup, he started in on the legislation.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He's not a partisan politics kind of guy.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He hates all politicians.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He originally came to New Mexico recruited as the chief medical officer at a major hospital in Albuquerque.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He quit after several years and opened his own single general practice.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I asked him why he quit the major hospital, and he simply replied, "I got tired of the bureaucratic mess."</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He thinks ObamaCare will make things even messier.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And so do I. 
 Quite simply, ObamaCare is a national disgrace and its legislation clearly exceeds constitutional authority.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It is patently unconstitutional for the federal government to break the backs of New Mexicans by trampling the Constitution, and then threaten to use IRS agents to enforce this ridiculous plan.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As written, the bill states if a New Mexican citizen doesn't have health insurance and takes no action, he or she will be committing a crime in the eyes of ObamaCare.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Gov.-elect Susana Martinez (and Attorney General Gary King, for that matter) really needs to get that message and make the decision that, like 20 other states and counting, New Mexico is not going to join the unconstitutional coercive actions of the federal government.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The push-back is already happening.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This week in the state of Virginia, a U.S. district judge became the first federal judge to strike down the law, siding with the Virginia attorney general in saying that the mandate overstepped the Constitution.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a few years, New Mexicans taxpayers will be forced to pay millions of dollars for the program and eventually several billion dollars when the federal government forces the entire plan onto the backs of New Mexican taxpayers.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Specifically, the lawsuit, filed in federal court in the northern district of Florida, alleges that the new law infringes upon the constitutional rights of citizens by mandating all citizens and legal residents have qualifying health care coverage or pay a tax penalty.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">By imposing such a mandate, the law exceeds the powers of the United States under Article I of the Constitution.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even more, the tax penalty required under the law constitutes an unlawful direct tax in violation of Article I, sections 2 and 9 of the Constitution.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The lawsuit further claims the nationalized health care plan infringes on the sovereignty of the states and the 10th Amendment to the Constitution by imposing onerous new operating rules that New Mexico must follow - as well as requiring our state to spend additional dollars without providing funds or resources to meet the state's cost of implementing the law.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">ObamaCare has just started to kick in.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Companies are canceling or threatening to cancel coverage because the new terms of doing business make business uneconomical.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In a recent national survey, 70 percent of doctors polled stated they were unhappy with the Affordable Care Act (as ObamaCare ended up being called).</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Some insurance companies announced they would no longer write child-only policies.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The new rules say that beginning now, no insurer can refuse coverage to an already-ill child, and that the premiums can't be higher than those charged for well children.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(In a few years the "anti-discrimination" rule will apply to adults.)</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">My curmudgeon doctor aside, how can you run an insurance company when parents can wait until their children are seriously ill to buy coverage - and then the insurer can't set the premium according to the expected medical services?</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That's not insurance.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It's welfare filtered through business.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At issue here is not the details of the more than 2,000 pages of law.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It's the discretionary power the government has acquired because of it.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A one-size-fits-all law was written by Congress.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I'm not saying it would be better if there were no components of ObamaCare enacted into law at all.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the second-best solution is ObamaCare without bureaucratic discretion.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Sure, if waivers are selectively granted, some of the harms of ObamaCare will be mitigated.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But if no waivers can be granted, people will see the full effects of ObamaCare and may rise up to demand its repeal.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Ultimately</MPQAPOL>, ObamaCare may be <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">decided</MPQAPOL> by the U.S. Supreme Court.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> start towards voicing our <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">point</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">view</MPQAPOL> about the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">unconstitutional</MPQAPOL> components of the bill <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be to join states <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">challenging</MPQAPOL> them.</MPQASENT>
