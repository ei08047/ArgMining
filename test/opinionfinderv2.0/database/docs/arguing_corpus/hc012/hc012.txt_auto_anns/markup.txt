<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A second chance to get health care reform right
 Barack Obama won my vote because he was idealistic and pragmatic and trans-partisan.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believed him when he said he was committed to addressing the big issues where we had allowed things to drift into dangerous territory because of the flaws in our old politics: overdependence on special interests and growing polarization.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I believed Obama when he said he would appeal to our most fundamental human values and our most important overarching goals.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He would help us see where we all -- Republicans and Democrats, blacks and whites and others -- shared ideals and dreams.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Then he would help us develop the creative new ideas that would allow us to work together to face the big issues, not sidestep them.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obama as a candidate in 2008 said health care costs were growing at a rate that would bankrupt our country.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">People without insurance were being left out of the system.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All attempts to reduce government deficits were doomed to fail if health care costs continued to mushroom.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">He told us we needed to change the dynamics so health care would be accessible to all while consuming less of our national wealth, rather than constantly consuming more.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I agreed with all this.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">To get health care cost containment and expanded health care coverage, we needed a president who recognized the urgency of the issue, would go all out to address it, and would be able to create a trans-partisan creative environment in which the best ideas of each political faction could become resources for a new solution.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So far, Obama has not lived up to my hopes or our needs when it comes to health care policy.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He didn't come equipped with a rock-solid vision for a new system that would work.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He didn't look very far for ideas.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He left the initiative to congressional leaders with truncated partisan perspectives.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He endorsed a flawed approach.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And worst of all, instead of presiding over trans-partisan creativity, he sat by while tawdry backroom politics were used to sell off favors in exchange for votes.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The current Democratic plan is hardly the product of a reality-based process.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Health care costs are skyrocketing because so many of us use insurance paid for by someone else to fund most of our health care.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We practically ignore the true costs of our health care, even if we pay modest co-pays and deductibles, because the most important costs are covered for us.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As a result, neither those who consume health care, nor those who produce it, have any natural incentive to curb costs.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We are playing with a law of nature here.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If people making choices about consuming health care are insulated from the costs of their choices, they will consume more health care.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The more they are insulated, the more they will consume.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Insulate them entirely -- make health care free -- and there will be no effective limit to how much they will consume, unless that limit is provided by some outside force.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Democrats' insurance reform proposal will make insurance available to more people, but in every other way it will reinforce the dynamics that are inflating costs -- unless government officials start limiting our access to the system.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Costs will go up faster or access will be limited by agencies beholden to the political system (with all the attendant opportunities for incompetence, indolence, corruption and abuse), or both.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most likely both.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I oppose the Democratic health care plan because I'm certain it will make problems worse, not better.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But I also think good health care reform is possible.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I have seen ideas with elements that, when combined, could do much better than the current plan.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden proposed some of them last year.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Martin Feldstein proposed another approach last fall in which every American would get vouchers with which to purchase health care insurance, with a deductible scaled to income calibrated to make consumers pay attention to costs but still be manageable under most families' budgets.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These aren't perfect ideas.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But now that Scott Brown has been elected to the Senate, Obama will need to recalibrate his approach.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If he can learn from the botched first attempt, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">open</MPQAPOL> lines to all <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">points</MPQAPOL> on the political spectrum, and start mining them for <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">ideas</MPQAPOL> and cultivating them for <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">allies</MPQAPOL>, he has all the intellectual and personal tools to pull off <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">real</MPQAPOL> health care <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reform</MPQAPOL> this summer, or <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">maybe</MPQAPOL> in 2011 -- and in the process establish his credibility to tackle the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">even</MPQAPOL> bigger issues (our <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">stagnant</MPQAPOL> economy, global warming, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">terrorism</MPQAPOL>) that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">lurk</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">just</MPQAPOL> beyond health care.</MPQASENT> 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Ron Mock is an associate professor of political science and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">peace</MPQAPOL> studies at George Fox University in Newberg.</MPQASENT>
