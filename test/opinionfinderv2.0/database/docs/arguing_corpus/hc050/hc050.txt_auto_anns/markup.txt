President Obama says his health care "reform" will be good for business.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Business has learned the truth.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Three successful businessmen explained to me how Obamacare is a reason that unemployment stays high.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its length and complexity make businessmen wary of expanding.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">Mike Whalen, CEO of Heart of America Group, which runs hotels and restaurants, said that when he asked his company's health insurance experts to summarize the impact of Obamacare, "the three of them kind of looked at each other and said, 'We've gone to seminar after seminar, and, Mike, we can't tell you.'</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I think that just kind of sums up the uncertainty."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Brad Anderson, CEO of Best Buy, added that Obamacare makes it impossible to achieve even basic certainty about future personnel costs:

"If I was trying to get you to fund a new business I had started and you asked me what my payroll was going to be three years from now per employee, if I went to the deepest specialist in the industry, he can't tell me what it's actually going to cost, let alone what I'm going to be responsible for."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">You would think a piece of legislation more than a thousand pages long would at least be clear about the specifics.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But a lot of those pages say: "The secretary will determine ..." That means the secretary of health and human services will announce the rules sometime in the future.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">How can a business make plans in such a fog?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">John Allison, former CEO of BB&T, the 12th biggest bank in America, pointed out how Obamacare encourages employers not to insure their employees.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under the law, an employer would be fined for that.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the penalty at present -- about $2,000 -- is lower than the cost of a policy.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"What that means is in theory every company ought to dump their plan on the government plan and pay the penalty," he said.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"So you don't really know what the cost is because it's designed to fail."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of course, then every employee would turn to the government-subsidized health insurance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Maybe that was the central planners' intention all along.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">An owner of 12 IHOPS told me that he can't expand his business because he can't afford the burden of Obamacare.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many of his waitresses work part time or change jobs every few months.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He hadn't been insuring them, but Obamacare requires him to.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="subj">He says he can't make money paying a $2,000 penalty for every waitress, so he's cancelled his plans to expand.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's one more reason why job growth hasn't picked up post-recession.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Of course, we were told that government health care would increase hiring.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">After all, European companies don't have to pay for their employees' health insurance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If every American employer paid the $2,000 penalty and their workers turned to government for insurance, American companies would be better able to compete with European ones.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They might save $10,000 per employee.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That sounded good, but like so many politicians' promises, it leaves out the hidden costs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When countries move to a government-funded system, taxes rise to crushing levels, as they have in Europe.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Whalen sees Obamacare as a crossing of the Rubicon.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"We've had an agreement in this country, kind of unwritten, for the last 50 years, that we would spend about 18 to 19 percent of GDP (gross domestic product) on the federal government.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This is a tipping point.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This takes us to 25 to 30 percent.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And that money comes out of the private sector.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That means fewer jobs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is a game-changer."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He means it's a game-changer because of the cost.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the law's impenetrable complication does almost as much damage.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Robert Higgs of the Independent Institute is right: If you wonder why businesspeople are not investing and reviving the economy, the answer lies in all the question marks that Obamacare and other new regulations confront them with.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Higgs calls this "regime uncertainty."</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's also what prolonged the Great Depression.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No one who understands the nature of government as the wielder of force -- as opposed to the peaceful persuasion of the free market -- is surprised by this.</MPQASENT>
