<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(Newt Gingrich) – If you had any doubt about the importance of repealing the health reform law, a new chart from the Center for Health Transformation will give you 1,968 reasons to repeal the bill.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The chart, titled “The New and Expanded Secretarial Powers in the Health Reform Law” reveals the ways in which the 2,700-page health reform law grants 1,968 powers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Control over the largest single sector of the American economy (about 18% of GDP, or one out of every five dollars in the entire economy) and a matter of life and death for every American, will be handed over to one appointed bureaucrat.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Here are five outrageous examples the Center for Health Transformation found in the 1,968 grants of power:

1.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Secretary determines “clinical concern”of drugs — Section 3307 — (ii) IDENTIFICATION OF DRUGS IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES AND CLASSES.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(I) … the Secretary shall identify, as appropriate, categories and classes of drugs for which the Secretary determines are of clinical concern.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(II) CRITERIA.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Secretary shall use criteria established by the Secretary in making any determination under subclause (I).</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(iii) IMPLEMENTATION.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Secretary shall establish the criteria … and any exceptions … through the promulgation of a regulation which includes a public notice and comment period.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Meaning: The Secretary will decide what clinical drugs seniors can access.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">2.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Secretary decides how drugs are dispensed in long-term care facilities — Section 3310 — (3) REDUCING WASTEFUL DISPENSING OF OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Secretary shall require PDP sponsors of prescription drug plans to utilize specific, uniform dispensing techniques, as determined by the Secretary, in consultation with … any other stakeholders the Secretary determines appropriate … when dispensing covered part D drugs to enrollees who reside in a long-term care facility in order to reduce waste associated with 30-day fills.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meaning: The Secretary will instruct physicians and nurses exactly how to give a drug to their patients in long-term care facilities.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">3.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">“Tooth-level surveillance” — Section 4102– (2) NATIONAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION EXAMINATION SURVEY.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Secretary shall develop oral healthcare components that shall include tooth-level surveillance for inclusion in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey … the term ‘tooth-level surveillance’ means a clinical examination where an examiner looks at each dental surface, on each tooth in the mouth and as defined by the Division of Oral Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Meaning: The Secretary will determine how dentists and dental hygienists should examine your teeth.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">4.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The Secretary may establish insurance premium ratings for states – Section 1201 — FAIR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS … SECRETARIAL REVIEW … With respect to the premium rate charged by a health insurance issuer for health insurance coverage offered in the individual or small group market … Each State shall establish 1 or more rating areas within that State for purposes of applying the requirements of this title.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Secretary shall review the rating areas established by each State under subparagraph (A) to ensure the adequacy of such areas for purposes of carrying out the requirements of this title.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If the Secretary determines a State’s rating areas are not adequate, or that a State does not establish such areas, the Secretary may establish rating areas for that State.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Meaning: The Secretary can overrule states on what insurance rates can be whether they like it or not.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">5.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Secretary may use comparative effectiveness research — Section 6301(c) — LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN USES OF COMPARITIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH… (2) Paragraph (1) shall not be construed as preventing the Secretary from using evidence or findings from such comparative clinical effectiveness research in determining coverage, reimbursement, or incentive programs under title XVIII based upon a comparison of the difference in the effectiveness of alternative treatments in extending an individual’s life due to the individual’s age, disability, or terminal illness.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Meaning: The Secretary can use comparative effectiveness research to determine access to care for seniors, like they do for patients in the British National Health Service.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Warnings about the Dictatorial Nature of Big Government

This report confirms what I warned about in my book, To Save America: Stopping Obama’s Secular Socialist Machine, which has just been released in an updated paperback, about how the rush to socialism under the Obama administration puts all our freedoms at risk.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Of course, I am hardly the first to warn about the inherently totalitarian nature of big government:

Thomas Jefferson warned in a letter to Charles Hammond that “When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated.”</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Freidrich Hayek warned in the Road to Serfdom that “The more the state ‘plans,’ the more difficult planning becomes for the individual.”</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Hayek also wrote in The Constitution of Liberty, “Once wide coercive powers are given to governmental agencies for particular purposes, such powers cannot be effectively controlled by democratic assemblies.”</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even George Orwell, who was a left wing intellectual, understood the danger of giving too much power to unelected bureaucrats.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Orwell’s novel, 1984, described dictatorship in London, not Moscow.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He agreed with Hayek’s concerns in a review of the Road to Serfdom: “It cannot be said too often…collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamed of.”</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Dictatorial Powers Inspire Dictatorial Behavior:
Kathleen Sebelius as a Case Study

These warnings about the corrupting nature of big government are already being shown to be true through the actions of Kathleen Sebelius, the current Secretary of the Health and Human Services.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Flushed with the promise of these 1,968 new grants of authority to her office, Secretary Sebelius recently made a series of threats to use one of these new powers to punish health insurance companies who have dared to tell the truth about how the health reform law has led to rate hikes for their customers.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The idea of an unelected bureaucrat using her power to punish those who exercise their right to free speech should be considered abhorrent in a society that values liberty.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Also, as Karl Rove astutely pointed out in the Wall Street Journal , Secretary Sebelius has also used her new powers to reward her friends.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Secretary has granted a number of companies exemptions from key requirements in Obamacare.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">More than a third of these companies’ employees are unionized compared to a mere 7% of the national workforce.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No Bureaucrat Should Have This Power

To be clear, the danger posed by Obamacare’s unprecedented centralization of power over our health decisions is bigger than the current occupant of the Secretary of HHS.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">No unelected bureaucrat should have this amount of power, whether he or she is in a Democratic or Republican administration.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The genius of the founding fathers is that they understood the fallen nature of man and designed a system of government to prevent any one person from being so powerful that he or she could violate the rights of any citizen.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every step we take toward bigger and bigger government throws this delicate balance off kilter.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">As Milton Friedman warns, giving power to bureaucrats to right the wrongs of society inevitably leads to worse results than that achieved by free people pursuing happiness on their own.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">“Where in the world do you find these angels,” Friedman asks “that are going to reorganize society for us?”</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Considering the warning of Friedman and many more of history’s great thinkers on liberty, is it really any surprise that a political appointee would use new, unprecedented powers to reward friends and punish opponents?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">very</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fact</MPQAPOL> that the Secretary is now <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">so</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">powerful</MPQAPOL> that she can unilaterally <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">punish</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">opponents</MPQAPOL> of the new healthcare law <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">shows</MPQAPOL> how <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">dangerous</MPQAPOL> this bill is to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">freedom</MPQAPOL> of the American people.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And this new study rom the Center for Health Transformation <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">shows</MPQAPOL> that there are 1,968 <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reasons</MPQAPOL> why all Americans who <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">value</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">liberty</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">insist</MPQAPOL> their elected representatives <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">full</MPQAPOL> repeal of the healthcare law.</MPQASENT>
