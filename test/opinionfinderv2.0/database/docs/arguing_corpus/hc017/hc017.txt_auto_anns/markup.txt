 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The bill that passed the Senate Thursday is a monstrosity.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It is pock-marked with rotten pork added in backroom deals.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If not fixed in conference committee, it could wind up costing New York a billion dollars a year.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And it is a huge step forward for America.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This legislation finally starts giving some basic protections to regular people who for years have been at the mercy of insurance companies.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No more having coverage denied based on a preexisting condition or dropped when you get sick.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It finally gives every citizen - 31 million more by nonpartisan calculations - the chance to buy health care coverage at an affordable rate, through newly created exchanges where people can pool their risk.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It holds the promise of beginning to bend the health care "cost curve" that threatens to bankrupt the country as the baby boomers retire.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not enough - not even close - but every journey begins with a first step.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fully, 62% of all bankruptcies filed in 2007 were linked to medical expenses.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Every day, in the world's wealthiest country, people lose everything because their bills, often from catastrophic illnesses, overwhelm them.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Talk about adding insult to injury.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Now, finally, there's some semblance of a safety net.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In no way, shape or form, is this "government-run" health care, as critics insist.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It is government-regulated care.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That is something the people deserve in a nation where the government is entrusted to safeguard the safety of our air and drinking water and ensure fair play in major financial markets.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nor is this a loopy, liberal solution.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The right-wing pundits hyperventilating that we're on the road to socialism need to check themselves into the hospital and get hooked up to an oxygen machine.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is a moderate, though comprehensive, attempt to fix a huge problem - to adjust a system that's simply unsustainable in its current form.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In broad outlines, the bill is a national version of the imperfect but important reform plan that Republican Governor Mitt Romney signed into law in Massachusetts years ago.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's light years less liberal than HillaryCare was.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Let it not be lost on critics that President Obama demanded that the bill be "paid for" - in other words, that all the taxes and cuts necessary to fund it be included in the legislation.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">President George W. Bush never felt this pang of responsibility when, for instance, he championed the new prescription drug benefit in Medicare - and that's why Sen. John McCain and other budget hawks opposed it.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the bill would reduce the federal deficit by $132 billion over its first 10 years and as much as $1.3 trillion in the following decade.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Prepare for a rough road ahead.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The legislation could emerge from the House-Senate conference as something that either the liberals in the House or the moderates in the Senate can't swallow.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On abortion alone, threading the needle will mean drawing blood.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">If and when this thing passes, the headaches of getting it through Congress will be nothing compared to the migraine-sized hangover of implementing something this complicated.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But guess what?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fixing <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">big</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problems</MPQAPOL> is <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">complicated</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It's also why we sent these people to Washington.</MPQASENT>
