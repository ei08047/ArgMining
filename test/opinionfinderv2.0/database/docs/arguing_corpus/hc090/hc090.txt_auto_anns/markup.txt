Affordable Care Act helps America

By MATTHEW SELLERS on March 22, 2011

Today marks the first anniversary of the Affordable Care Act.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In the memorable words of Vice President Joe Biden, it’s a “Big f***ing deal.”</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Biden’s words may only be remembered in jest a few years from now.</MPQASENT>

But the ACA will be remembered as a landmark piece of legislation which reshaped the face of health care to improve the lives of millions of Americans.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its provisions make sweeping and integral changes.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It provides insurance coverage to over 30 million uninsured Americans.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It simplifies enrollment into CHIP — the Children’s Health Insurance Program — which allows more children access to quality health care.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It improves prescription drug coverage and eliminates co-pays for certain essential services.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Perhaps most importantly, this act benefits the typical Red & Black reader.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It offers 1.2 million students the opportunity to remain on their parents’ health insurance until age 26.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Before the reform, 42 percent of young adults lost their insurance coverage once they graduated from school, according to the White House.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Affordable Care Act makes an investment in America’s future by ensuring we — the students — can pursue higher education and employment without losing insurance coverage.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">These reforms have attracted a great deal of praise — and sometimes an expletive — from one side of the aisle and a great deal of criticism and polemic from the other.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But despite right-wing assertion that the act will increase government debt, the Congressional Budget Office maintains the deficit will fall by $143 billion over the next 10 years.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Political alignments aside, the act marks a paradigmatic shift from a view of health care as a privilege for those who can afford it — to its reality as a fundamental right, regardless of socioeconomic status, gender or geographic location.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By recognizing that everyone — not just the wealthy or privileged — deserves access to health care, we improve our quality of life and build a strong, healthy future for our nation.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Yes, there are disagreements about the policy mechanisms by which America should achieve equitable health care.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But this historic legislation shifted the terms of the health care debate by acknowledging health care as a right to all Americans.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This demarcation of health care as a right will leave a legacy no lawmaker can ignore in the future.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On the anniversary of the ACA, I urge the University campus to look past the political clashes, the bitter partisan debate and the contentious implementation surrounding health care reform.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Look instead to its benefits.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">At its core, the Act equalizes a system that privileges the wealthiest Americans before all others.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Its goal is not to <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">force</MPQAPOL> America into a “socialist” system, but to <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">liberate</MPQAPOL> individuals of the <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">burden</MPQAPOL> of health care debt.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It makes the American <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">dream</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">possible</MPQAPOL> by <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">protecting</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">opportunities</MPQAPOL> to live a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">healthy</MPQAPOL>, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">productive</MPQAPOL> life.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If that isn’t an <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">idea</MPQAPOL> that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">should</MPQAPOL> generate bipartisan <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">consensus</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL>, I don’t <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">know</MPQAPOL> what is.</MPQASENT>
