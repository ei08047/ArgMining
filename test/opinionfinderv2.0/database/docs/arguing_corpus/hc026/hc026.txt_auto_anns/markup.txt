<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Debunking scary myths about health care reform
By Doug Bates, The Oregonian 
 Health care reform will kill old people.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It will ration care.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It is socialized medicine that will hurt Medicare, is too expensive and will let the Government make life-and-death decisions for you.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Oh, and it will also keep you from getting the care you need.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That about covers it -- did I miss anything?</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The spin machines and "swift boat" special interest groups are at it again -- using myths, misinformation and scare tactics like these to derail health care reform.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And it's no surprise - their business isn't fixing the health care system or addressing any real issues, it's waging partisan political warfare, deceiving and scaring the masses in the process.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The real victim is the American public.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">These efforts make it harder to get the facts and stand in the way of fixing our current health care system for simple political gamesmanship, nothing more.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here's a fact, most of us know someone who is struggling with the broken health care system -a neighbor who can't afford their prescription drugs, a friend struggling to keep pace with medical costs, a relative who can't get insurance coverage due to a pre-existing condition, a son or daughter just out of college, with no job and no health care.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For most of us this issue hits close to home.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And for all those millions of people struggling with a broken health care system, let's clarify a few things.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Myth: Health care reform is socialized medicine.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fact: It will preserve employer-based health care and provide a range of private plans for people buying coverage for themselves.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The so-called "public plan" option will give consumers another choice if they can't find quality, affordable coverage in the private market.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Every proposal would allow people to choose their own doctors and their own hospitals.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Myth: Reform means rationed care.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Fact: None of the proposals being considered would stand between individuals and their doctors or prevent any American from choosing the best possible care.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Instead they will help ensure doctors are paid fairly so they will continue to treat Medicare patients.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Myth: Health care reform will hurt Medicare.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Fact: None of the proposals would cut Medicare benefits or increase out-of-pocket costs for Medicare services.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They will lower prescription drug costs for people in the Medicare Part D coverage gap or "doughnut hole" so they can better afford their prescription drugs and reduce costly, preventable hospital readmissions, saving patients and Medicare money.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Myth: It's too expensive - we can't afford it.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fact: The President and Congress have committed to producing legislation that will be paid for so it won't saddle our children and grandchildren with debt.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If we do nothing, families with Medicare or employer-based health coverage premiums and the share of income spent on health care will both nearly double in the next seven years.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Myth: It will allow the government to make life-and-death decisions for you.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Fact: Health care reform will NOT give the government the power to make life-and-death decisions for anyone regardless of their age.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Those decisions will be made by individuals, their doctor and their family.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To be clear, no one, including the government or your insurance company, will be given power to make life-and-death decisions for you.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We need to move forward with the best solutions regardless of whether they come from Democrats or Republicans.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Members on both sides of the aisle agree that the status quo is unacceptable.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The final health care reform package will include a mix of ideas from both parties and both houses of Congress.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The standard AARP will use to judge the legislation is simple: Will it improve our health care system and provide peace of mind to our members and their families?</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We support the overall efforts to pass a health care reform package this year - and we have specifically endorsed efforts to close the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap, or doughnut hole.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">AARP would fight, with everything we've got, any attempt to prevent a doctor or hospital from giving the best possible care to their patients.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">We will continue to push to make sure any health care reform package includes specific measures to help our members and their families.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is an enormous task - it's one AARP has been working on for more than 50 years and we know it's difficult.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But Congress needs to get this done this year - American families cannot afford Washington's stalemate any longer.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We can't let health care <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reform</MPQAPOL> get derailed by the scare tactics of the few, aimed at <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">deceiving</MPQAPOL> the masses.</MPQASENT>
