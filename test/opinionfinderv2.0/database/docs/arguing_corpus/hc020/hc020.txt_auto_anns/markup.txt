<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Reforming Health Care Reform
Reforming the health care system isn't new.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many presidents and Congresses have tried and failed, most recently Bill Clinton.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Why, then, did health care reform pass under this administration?</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">According to Jamie Orlikoff, of Orlikoff and Associates, who addressed a gathering of community leaders in Rapid City, South Dakota, in December and whose consulting firm specializes in health care issues, past attempts may have failed simply because the status quo was still acceptable.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This time around, the broad view was that the status quo was unacceptable and the American economy would eventually collapse if nothing were done.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">However, the health care bill Congress passed in March 2010 didn't completely address the unacceptable elements of the status quo.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In particular, says Orlikoff, the issue of cost is still largely unaddressed.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The December 2010 report of the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, tasked with finding ways to reduce the deficit, said the health care bill didn't go far enough in cutting costs.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The single largest category in the commission's recommended cuts, four hundred billion dollars, was health care.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Health care, notes Orlikoff, is the largest expenditure of government and of the Pentagon.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If we are serious about cutting the debt, we must turn our attention to health care costs.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Health care also represents a large segment of private sector spending.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It's the largest component cost of an American car or tractor, while the largest component cost of a Chinese or Japanese vehicle is steel.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No wonder: China spends 4% on health care, India spends 2%, and the U.S. spends 17.5%.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Orlikoff suggests this is one reason American retailers can sell imported products so cheaply.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">According to the Institute of Medicine, 30% of what we spend on health care adds no clinical value.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That's a whopping 5% of GDP.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, reports that 4.4 million hospital admissions, costing thirty billion dollars a year, could be prevented.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Exacerbating the inefficiency of health care is that there are huge geographic disparities, with pockets of efficiency.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">One commonly cited example is the contrast between two Texas towns.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Despite similar demographics, McCallen has one of the country's highest health care spending rates and El Paso one of the lowest.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When it comes to end-of-life care for patients with terminal illnesses, Orlikoff notes that UCLA/Hopkins spends an average of $90,000 per person and Cleveland Clinic/Mayo an average of $55,000.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The difference in spending results in no difference in patient experience or outcome.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Orlikoff is also concerned that our burgeoning health care expenses will eventually spell the end of the US economy.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"The dust bin of history is littered with economies that fell apart because one sector consumed the economy."</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">He cites the USSR and its over-concentration on defense spending.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">One of the problems with the bill, says Orlikoff, is that 25-year-old, sleep-deprived kids on Red Bull wrote most of it.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Some parts were written by people who could write and understood health care, some by those who couldn't write.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For example, one three-page section of the bill has no verb.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still, if the bill is repealed, which is highly unlikely prior to 2012, we are left with market reform instead of legislative reform.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Orlikoff points out that market reform is much more random; however, my belief is that it's much more effective.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">As experts like Jamie Orlikoff continue to tell us, health care reform is nowhere close to achieving a satisfactory status quo.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Clearly</MPQAPOL>, we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> to continue discussing what we <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">want</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> to make our health care system one of the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">best</MPQAPOL> in the world.</MPQASENT>
