 Given their specialty of hamburgers, their drive-through catering to people in a hurry, their trans-fat retreat in response to activists wanting to dictate how the rest of us eat, McDonald's restaurants sum up many things American.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Add this to the list - a brush with the business-busting insanity of Obamacare.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It's true and still another signal among many that it's time to retire the power abusers who gave us this travesty parading as rescue.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The story is this.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">McDonald's and 29 other entities faced having to drop a total of a million people from any insurance coverage at all to avoid a demand by the new health law that they otherwise increase benefits for low-wage employees.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">They couldn't afford it and the government provided waivers negating its demands.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The incident recalls what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi once said - that the health-care remake had to be passed so everyone could find out what was in it.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even before enactment, with thousands of details still hidden, it was clear the concoction was going to be a massive mess, but the revelations since then have outdone the direst predictions.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The capacity of this law for mayhem?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Endless.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The McDonald's perplexity is just a start, but is worth focusing on for a second.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Insurance benefits for the workers in question are meager, but the idea that the remedy is simply to force businesses to spend more is economic idiocy of the first order.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The consequence could be layoffs or even eventual business failure, only here we also had the option of no employer-provided insurance at all, meaning that a law meant to extend coverage to more people could have eliminated coverage for many.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In four years, employers bowing out of such requirements would instead pay a lesser penalty helping to finance alternative organizations providing insurance.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If that sounds like everything would then be hunky-dory, consider that the exchanges would also be heavily subsidized by the government, part of a new entitlement on top of the old entitlements of Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid already threatening an economy-devastating debt crisis.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The reprieve for McDonald's and the other businesses is just for a year, and meanwhile, some other companies big and small are already taking a hit financially while still others are inhibited from expansion by fear of how this law would then punish them even more.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">All of this comes at the worst possible time, helping to keep high jobless rates intact - but wait, there's more.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The demands of this law are pushing numbers of physician-owned and charitable hospitals to either fold their tents or become part of much bigger outfits.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's also reported that bankruptcies are likely to flow from attempts by Obamacare to transform insurance companies into welfare agencies.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Premiums are going up partly in response to the law and will probably go up considerably more if insurance companies are to stay alive.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">States that already have their backs to the wall are also going to have to pay a ton more into Medicaid.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Let's agree that the law does some good while agreeing as well that we could have gotten where we needed to go by prudent, relatively inexpensive, non-intrusive steps such as tort reform, allowing national insurance-company competition and gradually redirecting government subsidies of employer-provided insurance to individuals.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Virtually everyone <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">could</MPQAPOL> have <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">improved</MPQAPOL> insurance at far less cost to consumers, businesses and the government than what we will get with Obamacare, an <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">extravagant</MPQAPOL> welfare-state expansion of the sort <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">much</MPQAPOL> of Europe is now <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">trying</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">undo</MPQAPOL> before Europe itself is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">undone</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
