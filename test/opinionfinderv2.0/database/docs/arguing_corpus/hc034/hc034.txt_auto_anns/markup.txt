<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The ObamaCare verdict: Constitution upheld
Thursday, December 16, 2010
 White House bluster didn't pass constitutional muster with a Virginia federal judge, who this week ruled that ObamaCare cannot force Americans to purchase health insurance by 2014.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In Virginia v. Sebelius, U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson shot holes through the legislation's "individual mandate."</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To wit: "An individual's personal decision to purchase -- or decline purchase -- (of) health insurance from a private provider is beyond the historical reach of the U.S. Constitution.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">No specifically constitutional authority exists to mandate the purchase of health insurance."</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Initially the Obama administration argued that the Commerce Clause was all the feds needed to force Americans to purchase health plans or face fines.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Losing its footing, the administration then insisted that the mandate is permissible under Congress' power to tax.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And this, after claiming that any resulting fine wasn't a tax.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Judge Hudson provides some much-needed clarity: "Salutatory goals and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">creative</MPQAPOL> drafting have never been <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sufficient</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">offset</MPQAPOL> an <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">absence</MPQAPOL> of enumerated <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">powers</MPQAPOL>."</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fight</MPQAPOL> will continue.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">About two dozen states including Pennsylvania have filed <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">challenges</MPQAPOL> to ObamaCare, setting the stage for an <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">inevitable</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">showdown</MPQAPOL> before the U.S. Supreme Court.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The sooner, the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">better</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
