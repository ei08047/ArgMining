Obamacare Headache: Get an Rx for Aspirin 
 Starting next year, consumers proactive and responsible enough to set aside pre-tax income in Flexible Spending Accounts to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses with their own money will be allowed to use the funds to purchase bandages but not Bayer aspirin, crutches but not Claritin allergy tabs, eyeglasses but not ibuprofen pain reliever.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is, unless those savvy consumers get their doctor to write a prescription for their over-the-counter medications.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That's right - getting a prescription for aspirin in 2011.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Apparently health care reformers believe the United States has so many physicians with empty appointment calendars that they are the Maytag repairmen of the 21st century.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The doctors apparently need to fill up their time seeing mildly ill patients - and collecting their co-pays - to write prescriptions for medications the Food and Drug Administration has determined don't require them.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The change discourages the kind of personal responsibility for medical bills that health reform was supposed to engender.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Instead, it encourages patients and physicians to game the system.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Most folks will likely take two aspirin and call the Flexible Spending Accounts quits in the morning.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">If the issue is the nation can no longer <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">afford</MPQAPOL> this <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">meager</MPQAPOL> middle-class tax break, then the looming 2013 <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reform</MPQAPOL> - a cap on what can be set aside in the accounts - makes more <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">sense</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Unfortunately</MPQAPOL>, the prescribed dosage is way off: The cap will be $2,500 while the average set-aside to date is <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">well</MPQAPOL> below it at $1,500.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Also <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">unfortunate</MPQAPOL>?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An alleged health care <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reform</MPQAPOL> that <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">kills</MPQAPOL> personal <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">responsibility</MPQAPOL> in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">favor</MPQAPOL> of <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">killing</MPQAPOL> time - and trees for prescription pads.</MPQASENT>
