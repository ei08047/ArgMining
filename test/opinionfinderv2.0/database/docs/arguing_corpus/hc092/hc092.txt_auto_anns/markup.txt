Repealing the Affordable Care Act will Hurt the Economy

The House Republican Health Care Plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away all the new freedom and control it gives the American people over their health care and give it back to insurance companies will not only raise costs for individuals and businesses, but it will hurt our economy.</MPQASENT>  

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Since the President signed the Affordable Care Act into law last March, the economy has created over 1 million private sector jobs, including the 113,000 private sector jobs created in December announced today.</MPQASENT>   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">So, at a time when our economy is getting stronger, repealing the law would hamper that important economic progress by increasing costs on individuals and businesses, weakening the benefits and protections that Americans with private insurance are already enjoying, and adding more than a trillion dollars to our deficits.</MPQASENT>  

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Opponents’ claim that the law is “job-killing” is in direct contradiction to what has actually been happening in the economy since enactment.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In fact, repealing the law would likely slow down the growth of our economy.</MPQASENT>    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Here are the facts:

    Since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, the economy has created over 1 million private sector jobs.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The unemployment rate is 9.4%, lower than it was in March 2010—9.7%.</MPQASENT> 
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In the period during and right after the enactment of the law, the economy grew by 2.7%.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consumer confidence in a range of areas have improved, including retail and food sales by 4%, and auto sales by 7% since the enactment of the law.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Slowing the growth of health care costs—as the Affordable Care Act does—will have the likely impact of creating more jobs since businesses will have to spend less on health care for their employees.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">This reduction could create more than 300,000 additional jobs.</MPQASENT> 
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The law widely expands coverage to Americans, thereby reducing the hidden tax of about $1,000 that families with insurance pay each year in additional premium costs to cover the uncompensated costs of the uninsured.</MPQASENT> 
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The law reduces small businesses’ health care expenses by giving them $40 billion worth of tax credits, and through the creation of new, competitive state-based insurance Exchanges.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Exchanges will enable individuals and small businesses to pool together and use their market strength to buy coverage at a lower cost, the same way large employers do today, giving them the freedom to launch their own companies without worrying whether health care will be available when they need it.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The law will lower the deficit by over $100 billion this decade and by over $1 trillion in the following decade.</MPQASENT> 

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Repealing the Affordable Care Act would have a devastating impact on our economy.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition to hurting some of the economic progress that has been made over the past ten months the Congressional Budget Office found that repealing the law would add over a quarter of a trillion dollars--$230 billion—to the deficit in the first decade, and more than a trillion dollars in the second decade; increase the number of uninsured by 32 million Americans; increase premiums for large employers; and will force consumers who buy coverage on the individual market to pay more out of pocket for fewer benefits.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">In addition, Harvard Economist David Cutler found in a report released today by the Center for American Progress that repealing the law would significantly increase costs and reduce job growth.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It will “…revert us back to the old system for financing and delivering health care and lead to substantial increases in total medical spending” by:

    Adding up to $2,000 annually to family premiums and increasing overall medical spending $125 billion by the end of this decade.</MPQASENT> 
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Preventing 250,000 to 400,000 jobs from being created annually over the next decade.</MPQASENT>
