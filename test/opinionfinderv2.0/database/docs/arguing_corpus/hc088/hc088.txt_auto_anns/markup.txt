What is the Affordable Care Act?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Healthcare reform kicked off in 2010, and some changes to tax credits and medical accounts will go into effect in 2010 and 2011.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But you won’t see major changes until 2013 and 2014.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There are two major pieces to understand, first the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Today, I’d like to discuss the first statute, commonly referred to as the Affordable Care Act and how it might impact your wallet.</MPQASENT>

    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Small Business Health Care Tax Credit: 4 million small businesses are eligible for a tax credit to help fund insurance for their workers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">A small business is defined as those employing 25 or fewer people, and the credit is up to 35% of the coverage cost.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Changes to the Flexible Spending Account: In 2011 one change that may impact you is that non-prescription (i.e. over the counter) medicines are no longer allowed to be reimbursed by the FSA or you Health Savings Account (HSA).</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">There is a specific waiver that permits insulin to be covered without prescriptions, and eyeglasses, contact lenses, and co-pays/deductibles remain approved.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Health Coverage for Older Children: Companies are now permitted to cover employee’s children up to age 27.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This may appear a bit old at first, but given the job market and students taking time off during their college years, many were left uninsured.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This provision helps close that gap.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Indoor Tanning: A 10% excise tax went into effect July 1,2010.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Licensed medical professionals treating skin disorders are exempt from this ‘vanity’ tax.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Employer-Provided Health Coverage: While not taxable, employers are encouraged to report the value of this benefit to their employees.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This is optional for 2011, but required next year.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Adoption Credit: The tax credit you can receive for the expenses associated with the adoption of a child is now up to $13,170 per child.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Further, this credit is refundable, meaning if your total tax bill was otherwise lower than the credit you qualify for, you will get a check for the amount owed to you.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Form 8839 will walk you through the income restrictions and other details to better understand this benefit.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Overall the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">intent</MPQAPOL> of the Affordable Care Act is to live up to its own name, to reduce and one day <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">eliminate</MPQAPOL> the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">high</MPQAPOL> numbers of us who are counted as <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">uninsured</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
