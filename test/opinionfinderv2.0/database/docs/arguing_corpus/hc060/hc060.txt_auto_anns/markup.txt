Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,

You are no doubt aware of the debate on health care reform currently taking place in the United States.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I recently attended a conference on health care, organized by and for religious leaders to help us understand the current discussion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">We heard from health care policy experts, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Mark McClellan (who served in the Bush administration) and other political leaders.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They assured us that health care reform can happen this year.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But we, the faith community, must act to make it happen.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jesus’ ministry was one of healing, bringing life to the dying, sight to the blind, wellness to the sick, and peace of mind to the troubled.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Jesus’ witness was that abundant life includes physical, mental and spiritual wellness.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The call upon us is to make this vision a reality for all.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Disciples have been involved in the work of healing at home and abroad for generations.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The General Assembly has twice spoken out on the need of health care for all (1999, Cincinnati Resolution, 9995; 2007, Fort Worth, Resolution 0724).</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Congregations know what it is like to help families when they have fallen through the holes in our health care safety net.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I am writing because I believe this is the moment of a generation – when the United States can finally make decent, affordable health care accessible for all.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The moral vision is there.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The policy expertise is in place.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It’s the political will that needs our support.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Our legislators need our encouragement in the hard work of reform.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I urge you – whichever of the possible options you might support – to contact your Senators and Representatives and ask them to achieve affordable, accessible, accountable, and inclusive health care this year.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In spite of media reports to the contrary, it appears legislators are close to making health care reform happen.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is growing agreement about what a renewed health care system might include: people who like their coverage would keep it, people who are uninsured or lose their coverage would have an affordable option to purchase it, no one would be excluded because of pre-existing conditions, long-term costs would be reduced by streamlining paperwork and emphasizing patient-focused, preventive and wellness care.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The big challenge is how to pay for it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Congress will figure that out, too.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It’s going to take compromise, but they will get there if they keep at it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We need to urge them to keep at it.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am inviting each one of you to get involved.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Contact your Representative and Senators about health care reform by using this toll-free number: 888-797-8717.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Visit the Disciples Health website (discipleshealth.org) for links to helpful information.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What we do together now can make a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">difference</MPQAPOL> for all of us, and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">especially</MPQAPOL> for those who do not have access to <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">affordable</MPQAPOL> health care, who <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">stand</MPQAPOL> in <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">greatest</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">need</MPQAPOL> of our prayers, our <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL>, and our <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">advocacy</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Thank</MPQAPOL> you for your prayerful <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">consideration</MPQAPOL> and action.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In Christ,

Sharon E. Watkins
General Minister and President
