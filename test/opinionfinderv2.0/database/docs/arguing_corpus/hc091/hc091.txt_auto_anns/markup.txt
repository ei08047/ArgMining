Why People with HIV Will Pay Dearly if the Republicans Repeal the Affordable Care Act
By Regan Hofmann on January 5, 2011 6:09 PM | 6 Comments
Well, they're here.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The 112th Congress is in da House.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Today, many a new Republican was sworn into the U.S. House of Representatives (along with the rest of the crew) and Congressman John Boehner (R-Ohio) was elected to be the new Speaker.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Congressional Republicans have claimed that one of their first orders of business will be to attempt to repeal health care reform: namely, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law on March 23 of 2010--a bill that was amended by The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act on March 30, 2010.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The House Republicans claim that the landmark legislation is a "government take-over of the health industry" and have set Jan. 12 as their target date for a take-down-vote.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Isn't it depressing that our nation's majority leadership would choose an Obama smackdown over, say, finding Americans jobs, fixing the state of our public education system and solving our economic woes?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">By trying to dissolve health care reform in order to undermine President Obama, they are throwing out many babies with the bathwater.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And guess who's in the tub?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yep, many of us.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Which is why we need to fight this repeal.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">HARD.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There has been massive controversy and confusion around exactly what health care reform will do for our country, its citizens and who will pay for it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But know this: a repeal of The Affordable Care Act will be a travesty for many people in the U.S. living with HIV (Think: pre-existing conditions, portability, high-risk pools, etc.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">See below for what it means for you, and your state.)</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The new Repubs believe if they undo any good Obama has done for the country, they will render him a seemingly ineffectual president as opposed to the effectual one he has proved to be (despite the crackpot, conservative, far-right media's abjectly false claims to the contrary) In doing so, they hope to prevent his re-election.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not sure exactly what President Obama has done?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Get your news exclusively from Fox?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Then absolutely check this out: http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/ (Apologies in advance for the profanity, but it's a good site nonetheless.)</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I don't care if you hate Obama or are a Republican.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I am absolutely non-partisan when it comes to the things that will deliver the most good to the most numbers of people.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I voted for Obama and am a supporter.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But if this bill hurt people in our community, I'd be first in line to take it down.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But the Republican plan to put the kibosh on health care reform is nothing more than political-territorial-pissing.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And we, as Americans living in a democracy, shouldn't let the people we elected to protect and serve us undermine our health care rights in the name of party power.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">If you think it's a bad bill, or don't understand it, maybe you should look at the facts more carefully.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No, it's not perfect.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">No, I couldn't even pretend to understand its reach, complexities and impact.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But I do know enough about the facts of this legislation to know that it will absolutely give more access to care for people living with HIV.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">While the Repubs are trying to undo health care reform from high atop Capitol Hill, they're getting some help across the nation from the right-wing media.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">According to Media Matters for America (a web-based not-for-profit 501(c)(3) progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media) outlets like Fox and others are resuscitating claims that recent changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements constitute the creation of "death panels."</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(Note: The claim was dubbed "Politifact's 2009 'Lie of the Year'.")</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Politifact, run by the St. Petersburg Times, won a Pulitzer Prize in 2009.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">So, the journalist in me is inclined to trust them before say, Fox.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I have to say, as an American journalist, I find it enormously disturbing that giant media outlets go unchallenged when reporting absolute untruths.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">I can't solve that problem and I get the circle of giganto bucks that ensures the lack of debunking of these lies on the networks and in the media vehicles that report them.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But I can use this media platform to encourage you to open your mind to the truth and to help us fight for a piece of legislation that will keep people from dying of AIDS.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Here's what you can do: call your state and federal government officials and educate your friends and family members about the need to protect the Affordable Care Act and ask them to do the same.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It's easy.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just follow this advice from our friends at the National Minority AIDS Council:

"Take action by contacting your elected officials and urging them to defend the Affordable Care Act of 2010 against attacks and claims that are detrimental to the public health of our nation.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To find out who your congressmen and/or congresswomen are, please visit: whoismyrepresentative.com and enter your zipcode.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This website contains links to Congressmen's websites, address, and direct phone number.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Alternatively, the following main switchboard numbers can transfer you to their office: Senate (two representatives per state): (202) 224-3121; House of Representatives (one representative per local district): (202) 225-3121."</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">To prepare yourself, review the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' summary of why we need the Affordable Care Act.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">(Don't forget to click on your state at the bottom to see specifics!)</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">DHHS Summary:
As a result of the Affordable Care Act, families will soon be free from the constant worry that they will not be able to get health care when they need it the most.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But repealing the law would strip Americans of this new freedom and take us back to the days when big insurance companies had the power to decide what care residents of the United States could receive--allowing them to once again deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, cancel coverage when people get sick, and place limits on the amount of care people can get, even if they need it.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">What's more, without the law, insurance companies could overcharge for insurance just to boost their profits, or use fine print to deny medical treatments that are covered under people's policies.</MPQASENT>


<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In addition, repealing the law would add at least a trillion dollars to the deficit, which America cannot afford, nor do we want to pass that debt to our children and grandchildren.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">At a time when American residents will soon be finally free from worrying that affordable coverage will not be available to them and their families when they need it the most, repealing the Affordable Care Act would be devastating.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">American residents, providers, small businesses and other employers would be denied critical new benefits of the law, from protections against insurance industry abuses to new coverage options and millions of dollars in support so the United States can deliver quality, affordable health care options to all of its residents.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Without the Affordable Care Act:

    Critical Consumer Protections Would Be Lost:
        Over 1.2 million young adults would lose their insurance coverage through their parents' health plans, sometimes just after they finish school and as they are looking for a job.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Families across the United States would lose the peace of mind the Affordable Care Act provides by making sure that young adults can stay on their parents plan to age 26 if they do not have coverage of their own.</MPQASENT>
        <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Over 165 million residents of the United States with private insurance coverage would suddenly find themselves vulnerable again to having lifetime limits placed on how much insurance companies will spend on their health care.</MPQASENT>
        <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Insurance companies would once again be allowed cut off someone's coverage unexpectedly when they are in an accident or become sick because of a simple mistake on an application.</MPQASENT>   <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This would leave 15.9 million people in the United States at risk of losing their insurance at the moment they need it most, as one of the worst abuses of the insurance industry would become legal again.</MPQASENT>
        <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Over 165 million residents of the United States would not know if they are receiving value for their health insurance premium dollars, as insurers in state would no longer be required to spend at least 80 to 85 percent of premium dollars on health care rather than CEO salaries, bonuses, and corporate profits.</MPQASENT> 
        <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">New insurance plans would no longer be required to cover recommended preventive services, like mammograms and flu shots, without cost sharing, nor would they have to guarantee enrollees the right to choose any available primary care provider in the network or see an OB-GYN without a referral.</MPQASENT>
        <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">44.1 million seniors in the United States who have Medicare coverage would be forced to pay a co-pay to receive important preventive services, like mammograms and colonoscopies.</MPQASENT>
        <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Medicare would no longer pay for an annual check-up visit, so 44.1 million seniors in the United States who have Medicare coverage would have to pay extra if they want to stay healthy by getting check-ups regularly.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Over 2.7 million on Medicare Would See Significantly Higher Prescription Drug Costs: In the United States, over 2.7 million Medicare beneficiaries received a one-time, tax-free $250 rebate to help pay for prescription drugs in the "donut hole" coverage gap in 2010.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Medicare beneficiaries who fall into the "donut hole" in 2011 will be eligible for 50 percent discounts on covered brand name prescription drugs.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Without the law, the burden of high prescription drug costs would hurt millions of Medicare beneficiaries across the country.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">States Would Not Receive Additional Resources to Crack Down on Unreasonable Insurance Premium Increases: States would not have new resources to review proposed health insurance premium increases and hold insurance companies accountable for unjustified premiums increases.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">States Would Not Receive Additional Funds to Plan for a Health Insurance Exchange: States would not have new resources to build a new, competitive, private health insurance marketplace for consumers that provides lower costs, one-stop insurance shopping, and greater benefits and protections.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">States Would Not Receive Funds to Support a Consumer Assistance Program: States would not have new resources to help protect consumers from some of the worst insurance industry practices.</MPQASENT>
    <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">4,748 Employers Would Not Be Receiving Help from the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program: Businesses, schools and other educational institutions, unions, State and local governments, and non-profits would not be receiving much-needed financial relief to help early retirees and their families continue to have quality, affordable health coverage.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Find a list of organizations in your state that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> not have been <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">accepted</MPQAPOL> into this program here.</MPQASENT>
