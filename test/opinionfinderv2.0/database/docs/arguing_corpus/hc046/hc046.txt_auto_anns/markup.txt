 Today, our health care system is more like a sick care system.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are responsible for seven of 10 deaths among Americans each year and account for 75 percent of the nation's health spending.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But too many Americans fail to get the screenings and visits they need to help them prevent these conditions and stay healthy in the first place.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That's why the Obama administration has made it a top priority to ensure that more Americans get access to life-saving preventive care.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">From the historic investments in prevention in the Recovery Act, to the first lady's Let's Move Campaign to end childhood obesity, to the Affordable Care Act, the administration is laying the foundation for a health care system that focuses on keeping every American healthy.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Last week, we took another step forward.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">As part of the Affordable Care Act, we announced that beginning Sept. 23, all new private health insurance plans will have to cover a wide range of basic preventive services without charging a deductible, copayment or coinsurance.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Eliminating cost-sharing for these services will help save lives.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Even with insurance, out-of-pocket costs for screenings, visits and vaccines can add up quickly.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now, Americans hit hard by the economic downturn won't have to think twice about whether they can afford a recommended mammogram or counseling with their doctor to help them quit smoking or lose weight.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just last week, I had the privilege of meeting some of those Americans whose lives would have been forever changed if their insurance had not covered the preventive services they needed.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">When Maggie's little boy John was born, she knew how important it was to take him to all of his well-child visits -- especially critical during the first year of life.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At his one-year visit, the pediatrician felt a mass in John's stomach.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Maggie's otherwise completely normal, happy and healthy baby had a stage 3 neuroblastoma that had spread throughout his midsection.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">There is no way that Maggie and her husband would have caught John's cancer in time without the routine well-child check-up her son was able to receive.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Twelve years later, John is healthy and in remission.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But every year, Maggie and John return to the children's hospital for his checkups -- and Maggie says it is heartbreaking to see the children there who were not as lucky as John to have their cancer caught in time.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Under the Affordable Care Act, more Americans will have the same fighting chance to beat cancer or avoid the onset of chronic diseases -- improving their quality of life and reducing health care costs.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The preventive services that must be covered by new health policies beginning on or after Sept. 23 include services for Americans at every stage of life, from counseling and screening to ensure healthy pregnancies, to regular well-child visits and immunizations, to blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol tests, as well as counseling on quitting smoking, losing weight and eating better.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Studies show that cost-sharing for preventive services keeps people from using them.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">When access to colonoscopies and mammograms cost hundreds of dollars, these important services can become out of reach for many working families or seniors on a limited income.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That is why the Affordable Care Act will also make it easier for seniors on Medicare and Americans enrolled in Medicaid to access critical prevention services.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And we're not stopping there.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The Affordable Care Act created the Prevention and Public Health Fund which is investing in community-based prevention initiatives and, this year, expanding the number of primary care professionals because you can't get a cancer screening if you can't find a doctor to administer it.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A new Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council, comprised of top officials from across the federal government, is creating a National Prevention and Health Promotion Strategy to help us become a healthier nation.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Together, our new investment in prevention is going to yield significant dividends for both the health and pocketbooks of Americans.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Keeping people healthy, and catching diseases early, can help lower health care costs.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">This will translate into savings for taxpayers -- and in reduced health insurance premiums over the long run.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">most</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">importantly</MPQAPOL>, preventive care can save lives -- like that of Maggie's son John.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And those savings are <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">priceless</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Kathleen Sebelius is the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.</MPQASENT>
