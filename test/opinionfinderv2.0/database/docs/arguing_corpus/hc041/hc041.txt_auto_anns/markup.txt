<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">ObamaCare & kids: Under the bus
Saturday, September 25, 2010
Here's how ObamaCare is "helping" California, Colorado, Ohio and Missouri families: As of Thursday, they paid more for coverage.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That's when ObamaCare's provision that forbids insurers from turning away children with pre-existing conditions took effect, prompting insurers WellPoint and CoventryOne to stop offering children-only coverage in those states.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">That means parents who've been paying less for separate children's coverage than they would have for family coverage will be paying more.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The insurers' actions are understandable because this ObamaCare provision allows families to delay buying health insurance until children get sick -- a situation that at best hikes costs for everyone.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">It's another unintended consequence that shows just how empty ObamaCare's bottom-line promises really are.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Cries of outrage from liberal groups such as Health Care for America Now -- which calls these insurers' moves "immoral" and "patently dishonest" violations of the ObamaCare law -- are the whining of those who misguidedly see a government takeover of health care as a good thing.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Most</MPQAPOL> Americans <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">rightly</MPQAPOL> don't -- and as of Thursday, California, Colorado, Ohio and Missouri families who have to pay more for coverage have swollen their ranks.</MPQASENT>
