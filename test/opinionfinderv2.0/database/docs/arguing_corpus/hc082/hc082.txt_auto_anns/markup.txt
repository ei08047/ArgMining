<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">A Majority Of Physicians Oppose Us Healthcare Reform

Healthcare reform is a highly debated topic these days, due to new legislation passed by President Obama late last year.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Although the American public seems to be divided in their stance on the reform act, the now majority Republican-controlled House is not its only critic- a recent study cites that many physicians themselves are actually opposed to the reform efforts.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Among the major points made, physicians polled feel that reform calls for a greater number of healthcare workers, many of whom are not required to earn doctorate-levelhealthcare degrees like nurse practitioners and physician assistants.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The report recently released by Thomson Reuters and HCPlexus details the results of a national survey which polled nearly 3,000 U.S. physicians on the issue of healthcare reform.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">The overall consensus can be generalized to say that a majority of physicians feel “frustration and dismay in a time of change.”</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of the physicians polled,

65% believe that U.S. healthcare will deteriorate with five years
18% believe it will improve
17% believe it will stay the same

If the healthcare reform act passed by President Obama remains in legislation, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), an estimated 32 million currently uninsured Americans will have will access to healthcare.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Physicians participating in the survey report concern over who will treat these new patients.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Nurse practitioners and physician assistants will likely begin seeing and treating nearly as many patients as physicians themselves.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">According to the report, “physicians overall have a clear frustration with the non-physician providers’ compensation, which is comparable to primary care physicians, citing that nurse practitioners and physician assistants are not as well-trained or as educated.”</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Nurse practitioners and physician assistants do have an education above a bachelor’s degree, but are not required to have earned their doctorate from a medical school like a physician.<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Healthcare degrees of all levels are in high-demand in response to reform efforts, which will require greater numbers of healthcare workers overall, in both an administrative and clinical capacity.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Online programs offering advanced healthcare degrees are growing in popularity as a method for working healthcare professionals to earn the additional credentials necessary to qualify for higher-level positions.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Results of the study also claim that a majority of physicians have a similarly cynical view on how healthcare reform will affect patients.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Results conclude that:

58% feel the legislation will negatively affect patients
27% feel the effect will be positive

Survey results distinguished responses among physicians of different medical practices, for example, as primary care physicians, or psychiatrists.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Of all participating groups, pediatricians and psychiatrists were the most optimistic about the future of healthcare.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">On the other hand, dermatologists were found to have the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">most</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">negative</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">outlook</MPQAPOL>; not a single dermatologist polled reported a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">belief</MPQAPOL> that current healthcare <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reform</MPQAPOL> efforts <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> have a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">positive</MPQAPOL> effect on physicians.</MPQASENT>
