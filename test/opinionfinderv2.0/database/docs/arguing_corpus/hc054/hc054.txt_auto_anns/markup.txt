Obamacarians told us that the more we learned about the law, the more it went into effect, the more popular it would be.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Wrong.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Rasumussen has consistently shown that about 55% of likely voters want it repealed.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Now the AP Poll reports that the law’s popularity is also sinking it its poll of adults.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">From the story:

    The poll found unpopularity for last year’s health care reform bill, one of  Obama’s major accomplishments.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">About half of the respondents oppose the health  care law and support for it dipped to 29 percent from 36 percent in June.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Just  15 percent said the federal government should have the power to require all  Americans to buy health insurance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Even among Democrats, the health care law has tepid support.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fifty percent of  Democrats supported the health care law, compared with 59 percent of Democrats  last June.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Only about a quarter of independents back the law.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That’s a remarkable political failure, even as the law continues to be implimented.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Obamacare should be one of the biggest issues in next year’s election.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">It was stuffed down the <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">unwilling</MPQAPOL> collective throat of the American people through a <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">cynical</MPQAPOL> and <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">profoundly</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">dishonest</MPQAPOL> political process.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The Supremes will tell us either in June, or <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">perhaps</MPQAPOL> October, whether the individual mandate is constitutional.</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">At some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">point</MPQAPOL>, the politicians will have to listen to the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">will</MPQAPOL> of the American people.</MPQASENT>
