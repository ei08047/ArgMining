<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">ObamaCare & AARP
Tuesday, December 7, 2010
 Had their employer been more careful about what it wished for, 4,500 AARP employees, retirees and dependents wouldn't be facing such stiff hikes in their health insurance premiums.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The 40-million-member group, which lobbies on behalf of Americans age 50 and older, provided <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">key</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL> for ObamaCare <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">just</MPQAPOL> days before its House passage by a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">narrow</MPQAPOL> margin.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But now, AARP is telling its employees that ObamaCare is a factor in premium increases of 8 percent to 13 percent that they'll have to pay next year.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">An Oct. 25 AARP e-mail to its employees cited rapidly rising medical costs as the main <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reason</MPQAPOL> for the premium hikes; the group's legislative affairs director has since sought to minimize ObamaCare's role in those increases.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Still</MPQAPOL>, the e-mail cited AARP's <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">desire</MPQAPOL> to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">avoid</MPQAPOL> ObamaCare's 40 percent tax on high-cost "Cadillac" health plans, which takes effect in 2018, as a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">reason</MPQAPOL> for changing its employees' coverage and premiums.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">AARP <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">contends</MPQAPOL> ObamaCare will be <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">beneficial</MPQAPOL> for its <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">broad</MPQAPOL> membership, whose <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">interests</MPQAPOL> come before those of its employees.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">That's cruelly <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">cold</MPQAPOL> comfort for those AARP employees, who will pay the price -- literally -- for ObamaCare and for their employer's <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">support</MPQAPOL> of government meddling that the American people <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">oppose</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT>
