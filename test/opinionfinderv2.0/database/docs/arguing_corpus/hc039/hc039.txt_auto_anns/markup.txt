 It's time for America's youth to buckle up and take a rough ride on the Reality Highway.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">For the past two years, President Obama has promised our children the moon, stars, rainbows, unicorns and universal health care for all.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">But the White House Santa's cradle-to-grave entitlement mandates are a spectacularly predictable bust.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Don't take it from me.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Take it from ObamaCare's own biggest cheerleaders.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Recently the Service Employees International Union informed dues-paying members of its behemoth 1199 affiliate in New York that it was dropping its health care coverage for children.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">That's right.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A radical leftist union, not an evil Republican corporation, is abandoning the young to cut costs.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More than 30,000 low-wage families will be affected, according to The Wall Street Journal.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who's to blame?</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">SEIU 1199 benefits manager Mitra Behroozi singled out oppressive new state and federal regulations, including the much-ballyhooed ObamaCare rule forcing insurers to cover dependents well into their 20s.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In a related development, over the past several months insurers across California, Colorado, Ohio and Missouri have dropped child-only plans because of ObamaCare-induced premium increases.</MPQASENT> 

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Untold tens of thousands of families who purchase their plans in the private individual health market will be affected.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">To sell ObamaCare and manufacture support, desperate Democrats pandered to the college set and their parents.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Former SEIU chief Andy Stern specifically touted the unfunded kiddie insurance mandate as a strategic selling point.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Now, confronted with the thorny allocation of scarce resources, profligate money managers at the SEIU are dropping thousands of kids' health coverage because they can't afford to foot the bill imposed by the president whom their union bosses spent more than $60 million to elect.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The SEIU also pumped tens of millions of dollars in union funds directly into the campaign for ObamaCare.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Workers regurgitated White House talking points hyping increased access, lower premiums and peace of mind for the working class.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">SEIU 1199 -- which is now cutting off health care coverage to children whose parents work in the health care industry -- was at the forefront of those D.C.-directed "reform" rallies.</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Yes, the union road to hell is paved with workers' own hard-earned dues money.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How far we've come from the halcyon moment when President Obama rallied college students at George Mason University in March.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">To wild applause, he pledged: "If you buy a new plan, there won't be lifetime or restrictive annual limits on the amount of care you receive from your insurance companies.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(Applause.)</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And by the way, to all the young people here today, starting this year if you don't have insurance, all new plans will allow you to stay on your parents' plan until you are 26 years old.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">(Applause.)"</MPQASENT>
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cue bitter laughter here.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">More financially strapped union affiliates like SEIU 1199 will <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">undoubtedly</MPQAPOL> be canceling children's coverage to escape the costs tied to Obama's vow.</MPQASENT>

 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">For the kiddie human shields who <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">helped</MPQAPOL> Democrats <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">dig</MPQAPOL> their own ditch, reality bites.</MPQASENT> 
 <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Live and learn.</MPQASENT>
