<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Who Does The Healthcare Reform Bill Really Help

Since the beginning of the healthcare debate, many things have been said about how healthcare reform will help all of us.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Lower premiums, a ban on pre-existing conditions and affordable care for those who don’t have insurance are just a few.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Many of the provisions don’t kick in until 2014, but the extra taxes have already started.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Our elected officials have decided in their infinite wisdom that 10 years of income collection vs. 6 years of benefits somehow makes this bill budget neutral, but they didn’t even get that right.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">We all know that the new healthcare law will cost far more than they have told us, but who is really benefiting from our additional expense?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">People with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied for health insurance, but they will be placed in high risk pools with subsidized and high premiums.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is a good thing for those that couldn’t get health insurance previously because of a health condition, but everyone else will have to make up the difference in cost.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Regardless of how you feel about income redistribution, this provision is good for about 15% of the population at the expense of the other 85%.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">They say the costs will be partially offset by government subsidies, but the government’s money comes from the same people in taxes; so one way or another everyone will be paying more.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Still, most people agree that something needed to be done to help these people and this seemed like the only real choice.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Children up to the age of 26 can now remain on their parents health insurance as long as they are in college or still living at home.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By the age of 26, Alexander the Great had already conquered all of Persia and assumed control of one of the largest empires in history.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">I don’t believe a person in their twenties can be considered a child, and there are many other options for young adults in college.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Parents still have to pay more to have their children on their policies, so this is more about additional income for the insurance companies from a portion of the population that hardly ever needs to use it.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This will help keep everyone else’s premiums down, but again, we are back to the income redistribution issue that most people don’t want.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">About 16% of the American population falls below the poverty line and these people don’t typically have health insurance.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">There is a mandate that starts in 2014 that will force people to purchase health insurance if they don’t have it, and Americans below the poverty line will be exempt.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Congress believes that the additional customers will bring premiums down to a level that will make it affordable for those below the poverty line, but most believe that this mandate is unconstitutional and will be thrown out; so where does that leave us?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">A healthcare exchange will be formed in 2014 that will put people into pools and make it cheaper to purchase a policy; but again for most people below the poverty line, premiums will still be too expensive to get.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">The idea is to make it possible for 16% to get insurance and mandatory for the other 84%, but what does that say about the America we live in today?</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">The new healthcare law does help some people without a doubt, but it hurts almost everyone except the politicians.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">This is yet another great example of the government trying to “help” us by telling us how to live our lives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">In 2014, the rest of our “<MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">help</MPQAPOL>” will kick in and <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">really</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">corrode</MPQAPOL> the level of our healthcare system.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">It won’t be budget neutral for the first 10 years, and it will skyrocket in cost the 10 years after that.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">All this when companies like Ameriplan and others already had <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">good</MPQAPOL> alternatives to solve the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">problem</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">All or part of the healthcare law may be repealed at some <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">point</MPQAPOL>, but we <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">still</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">need</MPQAPOL> to address the <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">needs</MPQAPOL> of those that <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">fall</MPQAPOL> through the cracks.</MPQASENT>
