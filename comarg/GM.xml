         <text>In answer to It is wrong to create fatherless or motherless families by design. Same-sex marriages have more to do with the desires of adults than the needs of children. Human experience and a vast body of social science research show that children do best in married, mother-father households..Bologna!!There is no solid evidence saying that gay couples put children in an unstable environment children need love and acceptance it doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is if you are capable of being responsible and compassionate- there are many good married Christian parents who abuse and shame their children- Children need positive role models not intolerance and a morality that picks and chooses what's right and wrong, and translates the bible to suit their own agenda.As for Ann Landers comment that gay marriage 'flies in the face of cultural and traditional family life as we have known it for centuries. And that's where I must draw the line. Sorry.- Obviously the first few thousand years of existence when people lived without marriage and in poly-amorous extended families, with different spiritual beliefs is not a part of history she cares to learn about Christianity was not the first religion and God is way too big to fit into such a limited un-inclusive belief system</text>

         <text>There is a mixed up message in culture today thinking the church is invading in political issues and that it has to do with our constitutional rights. This is the complete reverse of what was written in a letter by Thomas Jefferson when he stated, Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God; that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship; that the legislative powers of the government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should `make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore man to all of his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties. It means the government should not butt in with the business of God and the church. A True Marriage is between God, man, and woman. NOT Ones government or county!</text>

         <text>'Congress shall make no law... prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech' That's from the Bill of Rights. Same-sex marriage isn't wrong. It's actually sort of genetic. The Bible isn't meant to dictate what laws should be vetoed or voted for. Religion will never fit with Politics. There are just too many religions, and us Athiests are tired of it! We need to stop all our fussing about this so-called 'Bible' and focus on something like our economy!</text>

         <text>A lot of the comments I see on the right have to do with it not being right or going against the Bible. Since when are we a theocracy? Freedom of religion, people! Even going along with the Bible thing, it also sanctioned farmers selling their daughters as slaves. Should that be practiced, too, then? The Bible does not run our laws and government. One more thing: when the South was just becoming desegregated, many were against it. They said that it just wasn't right to be using the same facilities as blacks. Is this not the same thing? Just because we're brought up to believe that it's wrong doesn't mean it is wrong.</text>

         <text>Absollutely, gay marriage should be allowed. The contingency that some view marriage is religous values, however in the US we are guanranteed religous freedom under the constition, who is to say what each US citizens beleif in these values are? I also beleive when 2 people committ to each other in love  matrimony  deticate their lives to each other-who has a moral right to object? Lovedevotion should not be interferred with. Laws are to protect people not to constrain choices that cause no harm. No matter what an individuals beleifs are laws should not forbade the freedom of choice. Besides who is to say God would prevent love? God is love. As for those who say marriage is about procreation-what about those who cant have children, should they not be allowed to marry? God is w/in a person, the church may not be caught up w/Gods love,or caught up w/Gods love for all? There is no impirical evidence that gay marriages would cause divorce w/hetrosexuals-they been getting divorce for multiple years on their own. And what I dont get is why would a person care-or prevent those that want to married no matter the sex want to stop freedom of choice, whether by laws or by discrimination?</text>

         <text>America is not built on religious theology. It was suppose to be a place where EVERYONE can practice their own beliefs and religion; you cannot force anyone to practice your religion. For a Buddhist, Christian values, the bible are nothing. For an Atheist, nothing. This country separates the church and state; you cannot stop gay marriages with arguments of religion.   Some people are arguing that gay marriages should be stopped because they cannot produce children. Neither can infertile straight couples. And neither will straight couples who don't WANT children but CAN. What is the point of this argument when these straight couples won't be producing any children? Are we going to value people by what they CAN do? In that case, why not get rid of and kill all the disabled, the elderly, terminally ill patients, the mentally ill, the homeless, and everybody and anyone who can't be a potential benefit to society?  Also to be quite frank, in general, taxpayers don't want to be taxpayers. Many people don't have children and these people believe that it is wrong for them to be paying taxes for education. If we could all pay taxes according to what we believe, this entire country can go down because nothing will ever get tax support.</text>

         <text>As a gay teenager in high school I don't understand what the big deal is with excepting people for whom they are. People in my school don't think of me any different because I choose a different sexual preference then them, they RESPECT it, the way it should be all over. I have struggled for many years to comprehend this in a biblical aspect, and to be honest, I think its just as biblical as choosing your favorite color. Being gay isn't a choice, if it was the world would be MUCH different. People need to respect people for whom they are. If my partner and I want to have a legalized marriage, nobody should stop me, and quite frankly its discrimination.

Not allowing gays to marry is cruel and unjust they are people just like you and me. they feel the same thing that we feel. allowing the banning of same sex marriage is saying its okay to hate against someone wo is different. america is about accepting people for who they are and allowng them to live freely.  people say it is against God's will. maybe it is but we are not God and souldnt judge. in the bible it says only God can judge others not us. let them live there lives without judgment and them being marked as outsiders.</text>

You cannot get married (this is a RELIGIOUS ceremony between 2 people of the OPPOSITE SEX)  I am not religious in fact I oppose christianity and when making decisions as a country we should NEVER rely on the bible (besides in the bible it is never against homosexuality in fact 3/5+ of the priests in the vattican are gay.

         <text>By passing gay marriage laws there will also be non-discrimination laws, which seems fine until you look deeper. Non discrimination laws will require all treated equal and will force people into something they do not agree with. A church could be required to mary a gay couple even if they do not agree with it because denying to marry a gay couple would be considered discrimination. Gay marriage will destroy the already fragile balance between church and state and will ruin religious freedom entirely. Not only that but gay marriage can open doors for polygamy, incest, etc. to be considered marriage too, which is wrong.</text>

         <text>California voters have twice affirmed the self-evident fact that marriage is only for one man and one woman when they approved Proposition 22 in 2000 and Proposition 8 in 2008. But in the end, the truth isn't based on votes or opinion polls or mere feelings. When it comes to real marriage, human physiology clearly shows that a man and a woman are physically designed to fit together. Science continues to show that there is no gay gene therefore no special rights or laws are justified for those who engage in homosexual behavior. And study after study continues to affirm that the best environment for a child to be raised is with a married father and mother living under the same roof. Government schools and the entertainment media have done a powerful job of teaching moral relativism ad nauseam, while avoiding the teaching of real science and biology on this matter. And with no rigorous critical thinking taught in public schools, it's not surprising that the younger generation is confused about sexual absolutes and numb to societal consequences. The truth has always been, and will always remain, no matter what any law says, that if you don't have one man and one woman, you don't have real marriage.</text>

         <text>Considering all of the people that are anti-gay marriage due to religious reasons say that the bible states that it is wrong, then why would God CREATE people that are gay.  A person does NOT become gay, they are usually born that way.  If you think that God created all men and women then he created the gays too, and they deserve love just as much as any heterosexual couple does.  Also for the people who state that it will open doors for other sick minded unions, marriage did not start out as something sacred, most wives were actually concubines, and also most people were forced into a marriage for purposes of money.  So there is no way for us to tell someone that they cannot be married, if you do not like it then do not marry another man or woman, it is as simple as that.</text>

Also for the people who state that it will open doors for other sick minded unions, marriage did not start out as something sacred, most wives were actually concubines, and also most people were forced into a marriage for purposes of money.  So there is no way for us to tell someone that they cannot be married, if you do not like it then do not marry another man or woman, it is as simple as that.</text>

         <text>Either way, theyre going to be together. Marriage is a way to express that you love somebody and want to be with them for the rest of your life, and if two people who are not married can stay together regardless of what anybody thinks the let them be together because youre not going to separate them due to the fact that they are legally not allowed to be married. And besides that, many people claim that its a sin, and granted, its in the old testament, but then you must also make premarital sex illegal, along with disrespecting parents. People need to respect other peoples wishes and to stop bullying others because of the way they feel towards members of the same sex. I mean after all, doesnt this country go through enough discrimination without the bullying of gay people?</text>

Marriage is a legal matter and gays don't have their legal rights.  if you worry about how gay couples can't have children, guess what, there are many children in foster care and are waiting to get adopted so if gays got married and adopted children it would acually HELP  and why do people care so much about what other people are doing if it doesnt hurt anyone else then WHO CARES</text>

         <text>For Christians, the bible is clear.  The covenant of marriage is between God, a man and a woman.  Christian gays need to acknowledge this and make the decision themselves as to whether they want to willfully engage a non-binding covenant.  Enacting a non-binding covenant with God is virtually a non-covenant, so why bother.  Holding out the belief that you are entitled to do so, is no more different that being a non-perfect Christian, which is 100% of all Christians, and effectively no different theologically, than atheist getting married.  That being said, a government should not use the theological argument, unless they are a theocracy.  I don't think that our government is (anymore).  Legal standing is between people and their government, spiritual covenants between people and God are something personal and should be untouchable by government.</text>

         <text>Gay marriage is different from that of interracial marriage which was also banned at one point in that nobody chooses to be black or white, yet a person chooses to be gay.  Homosexual activity is unnatural and leaves no possibility to creation of children.  The marriage union is the beginning to creation of a family, and without that essential possibility of the creation of children there is no reason for marriage.  I don't see why homosexual couples can't just be happy with the same benefits of marriage but calling it a civil union not marriage.  Marriage is a creation of religion and as such should remain defined as a union between a man and a woman.  I'm all for giving them benefits, but not for including their unionization into the sacred definition of marriage.  This way we will be able to distinguish from our children the difference of a civil union and marriage as believed to be by most christianity.</text>

This way we will be able to distinguish from our children the difference of a civil union and marriage as believed to be by most christianity.</text>

         <text>Gay marriage is different from that of interracial marriage which was also banned at one point in that nobody chooses to be black or white, yet a person chooses to be gay.  Homosexual activity is unnatural and leaves no possibility to creation of children.  The marriage union is the beginning to creation of a family, and without that essential possibility of the creation of children there is no reason for marriage.  I don't see why homosexual couples can't just be happy with the same benefits of marriage but calling it a civil union not marriage.

         <text>Gay marriage should NOT be legalized for homosexuality is not natural. Marriage should be for the procreation of the species, not to satisfy sexual appetites. If marriage becomes about sexual appetite then what comes next? Incest, bestiality, polygamy, prostitution, rape. Secondly, marriage is not a natural right. We cannot do whatever makes us happy. If I want to go slit a dog's throat and put it on a stake, I can't do that because it's not right. It might make me happy, but what does that matter in life? We can't always get what we want, or simply do what makes us happy because it makes us happy. This only leads to the slow dissolution of our society. Marriage between gays because it makes them happy is a slippery slope, and we can't be on it.</text>

         <text>Gay marriage should be legal because not all people are the same! Yes the Bible does say that marriage should be between man and wife, but do we honestly follow every single thing that the Bible says. If we did, then people wouldn't have sex untill after they were married. Homosexuals should also have the right because marriage shouldn't just be about the sex we are. If a man or woman truely love someone of the same sex, we shouldn't discriminate against love. How would you feel is someone said you can't marry someone you love because they don't believe it is truely right. As long as that person is happy, then they should have the right to marry whoever they want.</text>

If a man or woman truely love someone of the same sex, we shouldn't discriminate against love. How would you feel is someone said you can't marry someone you love because they don't believe it is truely right. As long as that person is happy, then they should have the right to marry whoever they want.</text>

         <text>Gay marriage should be legal. It is plain and clear that discrimination is what is prohibiting the marriage of gay couples.  I am not gay, but i do have family that cannot marry who they want due to the current laws in our state preventing it. The people that are against it usually say that Jesus said its wrong. Well Jesus also said that cheating, drinking, tattooing, divorcing and many more are sins. Why do people say that gay marriage is bad. People should not knit-pick what rules in their sacred book they should follow. The government should make it a universal right in America. People who love each other should be together. Love is love and people will love who they want.</text>

         <text>Gay people do not have a disorder, rather we all are sinners, and some people struggle with different sins more than others. it is silly to say gay people can't get married because they can't have children. The only real argument against gay marriage is that it is unnatural as described in Romans 1:26-27 and at least three other verses. Yes, Christians are commanded to love, but not in a homosexual way. There's a difference between loving your girlfriend or boyfriend and loving people as stipulated in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. Other less important arguments that can be made is that a homosexual relationship can be physically unhealthy, but smoking is unhealthy, and people still do that. Furthermore, the Bible does not say to avoid judging in Matthew 7:2-6, because it says to not cast your pearls before swine and such (please no one assume I'm saying that anybody is swine; I would not do that ever); showing that you must first determine who the swine are, but ultimately, God is the only one who should judge, because he is perfect. Bottom line, we all need Jesus! Nobody needs him more than another! God's word is truth! (John 14:6) I'm a sinner that deserves to go to Hell, but I'm saved by grace!</text>

The only real argument against gay marriage is that it is unnatural as described in Romans 1:26-27 and at least three other verses. Yes, Christians are commanded to love, but not in a homosexual way. There's a difference between loving your girlfriend or boyfriend and loving people as stipulated in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. Other less important arguments that can be made is that a homosexual relationship can be physically unhealthy, but smoking is unhealthy, and people still do that. Furthermore, the Bible does not say to avoid judging in Matthew 7:2-6, because it says to not cast your pearls before swine and such (please no one assume I'm saying that anybody is swine; I would not do that ever); showing that you must first determine who the swine are, but ultimately, God is the only one who should judge, because he is perfect. Bottom line, we all need Jesus! Nobody needs him more than another! God's word is truth! (John 14:6) I'm a sinner that deserves to go to Hell, but I'm saved by grace!</text>

         <text>Gay vs Straight marriage is primarily a religious issue.  The marjor religious opposition is based on their belief that God prohibits man laying with man (and note nothing said about women with women).  No gay group are attempting to require any religion to marry them, and there is no chance they could succeed because the government can pass no such law.  Religious groups opposing Gay marriage remind me of how some religions opposed black  and white marriage because they felt it is immoral or a a slippery slope.  But religion and state government is by constitutional law prohibited from controlling the agenda of each other.   None of this has anything to do with the original purpose of marriage, namely to provide rights of inheritance.  In the end the only question that seems  to be ignored is how can two guys married and living next to you affect your marriage?  If some action by others has no effect on your life, why do you have a need to stop it?   How is it different from two straight guys living in he same house?   If marriage is for pro-creation then why not stop senior citizens from marriage.   What is it about the Ten Commandments, especially adultery that gets so little attention and homosexuality gets so much?  Why?</text>

We dont want our children growing up and thinking that oh its okay to marry somone of their own sex. Next think you know our children will be getting married with animals. Like me some people dont want gay marriage to be allowed and we want our rights to be respected. Like in the word of God it is said that he created a women so the man wouldnt be alone he never said he created women so the womwn wouldnt be alone.

         <text>God invented marriage.  The concept of wife is first shown in Genesis 2:24:  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. Therefore to say man to man and woman to woman is marriage is to redefine what God defined which makes it wrong. Other reason include: man to man sex is dangerous (AIDS), lower tax income due to more taking the marriage deduction, confused children not knowing who is mom or dad, cruel homophobic behavior (I don't condone) and last but not least, God speaks against woman to woman sex in Romans 1:26-27 and man to man in Leviticus 18:22.  Therefore if the leader says yes to what God has said NO to, this is indeed a slippery slope.  I want God to bless America.</text>

         <text>Homosexuality does not have immutable status. There are many reasons why people engage in homosexual behavior, including as a result of being molested by a same-sex individual. How can one say that if discrimination is supposedly occurring for homosexual couples regarding marriage, how is it not the case that polygamists, polyamorists are not being discriminated against? If marriage becomes anything that anyone wants because they want validation for their lifestyle, then the definition is meaningless. For those who don't believe in marriage (male and female for example), why not have the federal government grant benefits (taxes, soc. sec, etc.) to common-law sitiuations? How about if 5 women married 3 men...all should get benefits? What if 1 or 2 want to leave the marriage are the others still married, or will it be required that legal documents be redone? Will children of those marriages have 5 Mommies and 3 Daddies? Who gets the child, if there is a divorce and the child was adopted? Why not allow first cousins, brothers and sisters to marry ( if they are sterile) ? Why not? They may love each other and they may not be able to help it. Why not allow an 82 year old man to marry a 14 year old boy (if that's the age of consent)</text>

         <text>Homosexuals can bring children into the world naturally and biologicaly . Conservatives think that a homosexual can't have sex with a woman and that is why homosexuals can't have children. The truth is that there's two methods how to bring children naturally into the world . It's calles petting and has the same quality  like sex. No one needs to have sex to bring children into the world. A homosexual will find a homosexual woman and both can bring a children into the world. the family is gonna be big because the homosexuals also live together with their same sex partners . Means that all live together in one house with the children that is naturally born by homosexuals . It has a lot of Pro's for the child. Also millions of bisexuals bring children into the world and also have sexual contact to same sex partners . Not only heterosexuals bring children into the world naturally. When a man and a woman have  achild so it does not mean that it has something to do that there's heterosexual . Reproduction has nothing to do with love . If u like someone you can also make achild with the one . If the there's no one around and only a homosexual man and woman and they don't love each other then both will make children to continue humanity</text>

         <text>How dare anyone decide who I should love. It NEVER said in the Bible that God was against Gays. NOT EVER. So stop lying. People stuck in their religious ways are bringing back progress in the world. Remember when you all said being Black was wrong? Bet you must feel real stupid now. I'm not saying being religious is wrong. I'm saying that you can't stop people from loving who they want. Who are YOU to decide? What grounds do YOU stand on? All you're doing is making life difficult. And trying to stop this is pointless: Gay Marriage will be legal. I'm TELLING you. Stopping two people from marrying just because they're the same gender is DISCRIMINATION. If a Gay couple were to adopt a child, THEY WOULD BE RAISED IN A BETTER ENVIRONMENT. Can you imagine your parents telling you that you can't love someone just because of their gender? How stupid, how petty is that? How can you call yourselves right when all you're doing is stopping people from loving who they want? So what if Gay Couples can't Procreate? Thats a ridiculous argument. So if a Same Sex couple were to have too many children they can't care for, it's okay, but when a loving, Gay Couple, who just want a child to love, it's suddenly wrong?</text>

         <text>I am 16 and have been raised in a family where I have two moms. I can say that I have a good family, my moms have been together for more than 12 years now and rarely fight as to normal parents fight all the time. My family is constantly being judged,teased and mocked because we are not natural according to the bible. I have nothing against the bible I love reading it but come on, there are several things in there that are not natural. some examples; raining for so long there has to be an arc, Moses parting the ocean so he can save his people. My point is, people who are against people like my moms that mock and tease us (even my sister and me,even though we both are strait) learn that they are just in love and are only trying to get the rights they deserve. Same gender marriage should be legalized to get the same benefits that normal marriages get. don't be ignorant. don't mock my family, we didn't do anything wrong. thank you for your time if you have read this.</text>

         <text>I am a homosexual and honestly LOVE IS LOVE and why can't I live with my girlfriend ? So why can't I have a little paper that says I am married to the girl I love? Either way gays will be around and they will live and act like a married couple or go some where else .  And we we can reperdouce ,  by artfical or adoption and raise a child.  SO WHAT PEOPLE ARE GAY atleast they are happy , arent you? Either way population will grow , and if a child gets raised in a homosexual house hold, who is anyone to say its worse then living in a crack house or an abusive house ?  Gay Marrige is a postitive thing our world could use , gay people can raise a child BETTER then a father-mother household. A normal household parents are abusing their child and on dugs. LOVE IS LOVE why should people have to hide who they are to be normal Nobody is NORMAL if they where the world whouldn't be the shi whole it isand we wouldnt be at war. Why deny someone to have it say on paper their married? Either way gays will be around and will live and be togther as a married couple.</text>

         <text>I am against gay marriage because I try to do as Jesus Christ taught in John 13; Love one another; as I have loved you.  I believe that the love that Christ taught in this scripture is a love based on wanting the best for an individual.  I think most of the public today believes in 'tolerance' more than 'love', but I will not follow this pattern.  Homosexual relationships are strictly banned in The Bible in Romans 1:27, as well as in other verses, and I believe that making something that God has spoken against legal would be very disrespectful to Him and His infinite love for us.</text>

         <text>I am against gay marriage because I try to do as Jesus Christ taught in John 13; Love one another; as I have loved you.  I believe that the love that Christ taught in this scripture is a love based on wanting the best for an individual.  I think most of the public today believes in 'tolerance' more than 'love', but I will not follow this pattern.  Homosexual relationships are strictly banned in The Bible in Romans 1:27, as well as in other verses, and I believe that making something that God has spoken against legal would be very disrespectful to Him and His infinite love for us.</text>

         <text>I am doing an essay in school about pros and cons. this is the website we chose to use. i feel that gay marriage has nothing to do with gender or religion. marriage is marriage. love is love. if a woman and a woman or a man and a man love each other, then let them be. they have nothing to do with your life. why interupt their life when you gain nothing from doing so? plus, the government cannot force a church to marry a gay couple. they can only control the state. so for all of the religions out there agaisnt gay marriage, (i'm sorry, people who say their religion is against gay marriage) the government cannot do anything to you. i think that religions do not hate them, or not like them, they fear them. they fear the unknown. human minds have to make sense of things. this is an example. now, stop discriminating agaisnt people. it is against the constitution. this is a FREE country, and they deserve to be FREE too!!! that is how this country was made. for religous frreedom. they have as much right has we do to marry. marriage is about LOVE. not race, ethnicity or gender. before you hate gays or dont like them, look up the facts. dont base it on religion. i, am not gay. i am just supporting them. because it is human nature to do so.</text>

         <text>I am not gay and hate gay bashing. I am very religious, but I hope not the wrong type of redneckology mentality. I am not one to judge nor can not morally state it is unlawful in God's eyes because I can not actually say it is unlawful according the bible. However there is a passgae that states the marriage is of man and women. My comromise to give the same rights a marrage yet title it in law as Life Partners That ALSO protects the gays, AND makes it much easier to charge a person of a hate crime if they attack gays that are married. SO legally making all states that agree to a legal nationally life partners law also may give the gays more protection from from physical abuse by hate crimes Nationally Legaly More Enforced EASIER and it also would give them Domiestic Violence Protection within this proposed Nationally Legaly Life Partners  law that I feel would be more nationally acceptable. Plus, this is much easier to identify gay couples who also have health insurance needs that actually live healthier life styles in same states than heterosexuals.

         <text>I am opposed to gay marriage because it disrespects and degrades the religious values upon which the United States was formed. The founding fathers were good Christian men who recognized their dependence on God and sought to obey His commandments. John Adams recognized the importance of a moral and virtuous society within the US when he said Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. To legalize marriage between gay partners is to legitimize the choice to disregard a commandment of God. However, God will not be mocked. If we as a nation continue to publicly legitimize behaviors that are morally illegitimate according to God's laws, we will cease to have His guidance and support in our lives.</text>

If we as a nation continue to publicly legitimize behaviors that are morally illegitimate according to God's laws, we will cease to have His guidance and support in our lives.</text>

The institution of marriage is not being ruined by homosexuals it is ruined by the fact we can now go to vegas get drunk go through a drive through and be married then sober up in the morning and make it go away.

         <text>I believe homosexuality is a perversion of a natural/original creation. The question is why?  I believe  lack of spirituality, hormonal influences and mutations are responsible for the original outcoming. Women no longer can find a good man to take his responsibilities as husband and father, and since women no longer need a man for financial support they are given up on looking for Mr. Right.  Men on the other hand , are more guilty in crime, as they have abandonned their purpose in order to follow lustful ways, just attend a gay pride parade and you know what I 'm talking about. I don't like what is being imposed on us by this gay movement. I believe all sexuality should be discrete, and yet they allow themselves to force their views and way of life trying to make it mainstream. If you don't feel comfortable with yourselves, coming out won't make you feel better or at least in the longterm..you want to make society say its ok so you don't feel what your doing is wrong.</text>

Women no longer can find a good man to take his responsibilities as husband and father, and since women no longer need a man for financial support they are given up on looking for Mr. Right.  Men on the other hand , are more guilty in crime, as they have abandonned their purpose in order to follow lustful ways, just attend a gay pride parade and you know what I 'm talking about. I don't like what is being imposed on us by this gay movement. I believe all sexuality should be discrete, and yet they allow themselves to force their views and way of life trying to make it mainstream. If you don't feel comfortable with yourselves, coming out won't make you feel better or at least in the longterm..you want to make society say its ok so you don't feel what your doing is wrong.</text>

         <text>I believe in the US Constitution.  All persons in the US are granted civil rights, regardless of sex, age, gender, color, and other federal laws. That's what the US Constitution grants ALL persons and not just for heterosexual persons. Everyone talks about gays being a group; well, heterosexuals are also a group.  I truly believe that everyone should let everyone else do what they believe in and feel they should do and not impose upon ALL persons their rights or beliefs!  I am a Cuban-American, having lived here since I was 4 years old, raised Catholic, yet I am gay/lesbian.  As a gay/lesbian person, I believe in God as most Americans do.  Again, people should be left to do as they feel and love whomever they chose to do, regardless of whether they are straight, gay, or otherwise.  The sooner everyone, including the politicians, understand that they are violating the US Constitution, the sooner this country can move into a 21st Century.  Gay marriage is not the end of marriage, but it is the beginning of new ideas and open minds while still preserving a union of two people who love each other and want to be together.  Two people in love should be allowed to marry, regardless of their sexual preference.</text>

         <text>I do believe that if you love each other that you should be together, man/woman or man/man, woman/woman.  Of course you have the right to be together. But marriage is a religious thing, and religion frowns upon gay people, and the law was interpreted by the bible, meaning changing the law means changing such interpretations.  I just wonder if you want to get married to prove that you love each other or just to rake in the benefits of being married (I bet its either the love one or both)  So maybe they should change the law to give gay couples the benefits of being married without actually being married  But again gay people should have the right to be with and love each other.

         <text>I do not believe gay marriage should be legalized becasue it goes against all religious beliefs and the nutre of marriage. Marriage is defined as 1 man and 1 woman coming together not 2 people of the same sex. Homosexual couples cannot procreate and bring children into the world and help the population grow. If children are not brought into the world then our future will not be as it should. Also, kids do better if they are raised in a normal household, with a mother and a father. They need that love that moms and dads give. Being from a same-sex household they are not getting al the love they need and it will effect how they grow up and turn out to be.</text>

         <text>I do not think homosexuals should have any special law. Why should they have more rights than I do? We both have the same rights, but still they want society to grant them a unique legislation in order to do what they WANT, And this is not like racial equality laws.

         <text>I don't believe in gay marriage. Here's why: The word marriage was defined as between a man and a woman by the Christian religion years ago. It was a religious institution before we roped it in with benefits. So why don't we not put marriage under the law (by under the law, I mean with the documents, and sharing benefits, etc). How about if there is a want to be legally joined together the US calls it a civil union. Everyone gets one who wants to be together. Then, if one is religious, they can perform their own religious ceremony, whether it is a marriage in a church, or something else. This way everyone is equal (everyone gets a civil union), there is a separation of church and state (civil union under the state, and a religious ceremony under church), yet marriage retains it's sacredness for the Christians. Everyone is happy.</text>

         <text>I feel gay marriage should be legal because if two people are in love it really should not matter whether or not they are gay or straight. I feel society is against gay marriage because of religion and just because religion said something does it mean we should follow it. What if it told you every time you said gods name in vain you went to jail? NOT EVERYONE IS THAT RELIGIOUS therefore it would mean million of people went to jail everyday.

         <text>I feel that if someone in this country is bound to paying the same taxes as a heterosexual couple then they have the right to marry whom they consider their life partner.  Otherwise, if the people are so against it then cut the Homosexuals some slack on the amount of taxes paid to keep this country going. Personally I think that all homosexuals should go to another country where they are supported and pay taxes there, having that country flourish just like all the neighborhoods that homosexuals take over. They bring value to the area and then sell it off for more money to heterosexuals.</text>

I hear kids whisper things as he walks by in the hall, and it just breaks my heart. I am glad to know that many people do accept gays and lesbians, though. Everyone has rights, and people should be more respectful of them.</text>

         <text>I have a question....isn't america supposed to have seperation of church and state?  Just because SOME (yes not all)  Christians believe it is wrong does not mean those beliefs can be enforced on this entire nation!!!!!  Also if marraige is really only important for procreation...then shoudn't infertile marraiges be illegal?  Yes ridicoulous!!  And If a child supposedely needs both a mother and a father to ever be successful in this world....then why don't we ban single parents??  And it's not like there are poor starving homeless children out there...or children in orphanages that need to be adopted......and it's not like children are being born every day...Everyone needs to procreate or they are useless and WE NEED more children.....Yes I'm the queen of sarcasm.  But really I hope for a day when this whole country wakes the heck up and allows people to marry whoever they love....seriously only 10% of people are gay so it's not like we would loose our population because of it.  Gay people deserve all the rights in this Free Country.  Being Gay Is NOT a choice.  No one would choose to have a life where you are constantly descriminated against just by being who you are and where you are denyed rights to marraige.</text>

         <text>I have seen no theological argument that adequately applies to the issue.  Every argument I have heard, from a Christian perspective, is lacking the inclusion of God as the third party to the covenant of marriage.  Since atheists are allow to marry, the theological argument against gay marriage fails from the societal perspective of granting legal rights.  If we allow atheist to marry, we must allow gays to marry.  Or will would we be willing to additionally revoke the marriage status of every atheist or atheist couple?</text>

         <text>I hear a lot of Pro comments that wonder why so many Christians have an opinion.  Well first off, the homosexual movement has tried to take a Christian symbol which is the rainbow which represents God's covenant with His people and make it as their symbol.  And now the homosexual movement wants to have the same respect as heterosexuals by legalizing their marriage and claiming that there is no difference between the two.  Homosexuals have rights and laws protecting them against discrimination.  They have the right to choose who they want to express their sexuality with.  Discrimination is not the issue and whether God is for or against it is not the issue either.  The issue is whether or not homosexuality affects society and whether there should be a law protecting it.  Well first off if everyone was a homosexual no one would be alive.  Secondly, some psychologist say that pedophiles are born pedophiles and that is not accepted nor should it be. The question is not are they born this way, the question is how does this behavior affect society.  Plain and simple, heterosexual marriage is the safest way to engage in sexuality and everything else is risky behavior and there should not be laws protecting it.</text>

         <text>I see a lot of leaning on Leviticus to condemn homosexuality as morally wrong. This is the same book that states that you cannot wear clothing made from two different threads. Jeez, that mean-girl clique in high school always said we were going to Hell for wearing poly-blends, but I didn't think they meant it literally. Jesus was asked what the greatest commandment was, and his answer basically boils down to: Love God, love your neighbor, and love yourself. There is no room in there for hatred, if you claim to be a Christian. But, marriage is only for producing children! So, you're saying infertile couples should not be allowed to marry. Or the marriage of married couples who become infertile due to accident or disease is no longer valid. People like my aunt, who had to have her uterus removed so that she wouldn't die. She's not married to my uncle anymore, is what you're saying. Marriage is what it's always been; the child becomes an adult, leaves their parents, and forms a bond with another adult which becomes the foundation for their new family. Gender and fertility should not enter into that equation. And in a few more years, they won't. The wheels are turning. Get used to it.</text>

         <text>I think gay marriage should be fully legalized around the country because what is the worst thing that is going to come of it? The only thing that's going to happen is a man and a man, and a woman and a woman getting married. It is not like if other people express their homosexuality they are going to force you to be gay. If love should know no age, color, heritage, then it shouldn't know gender either. The Pilgrims came here on a mission to be free of religion telling them what to do and the government dictating their lives. So why should we be doing what is against the Constitution? If people are able to say what they want, they should be able to marry whom they want without the government getting in their way. The government should be totally separate from religion as stated in our constitution as well. People should be able to be who they are and not have to hide their true self from everyone as in a dictatorship, nor should they have to hide the fact that they are homosexual as if they will be exterminated for being so.</text>

Yes God exepts all sinners but that does not make murder right. I'm a teenager and I know how wrong it is. If I will get sued or be put out of society because of my views so help it but I will go to my grave defending the Holy word. I don't care if I'm killed because of it because I know I will at least see the pearly gates of Heaven.

         <text>I think it should be illegal and never even spoken of. To all the atheist who say the bible plays no part it is what will guide me to paradise. Yes God exepts all sinners but that does not make murder right. I'm a teenager and I know how wrong it is. If I will get sued or be put out of society because of my views so help it but I will go to my grave defending the Holy word. I don't care if I'm killed because of it because I know I will at least see the pearly gates of Heaven. I don't care what people say about me I am a Christian and will keep the truth alive be it through my life or my death. Stop corrupting children's minds. My little brother should stay innocent yet is exposed to this appalling sin everyday.</text>

         <text>I think that gay marriage should be allowed in every part of the world. If two people love eachother and want to be together forever then that should be it. Let them do it. The saying Love Is Love should be used. In the religious aspect of everything God says in the Bible that you should love everyone and treat them with kindness and compassion. So people who discriminate against the same sex wanting to be together are not Christians or do not believe in God. Places where they have same sex marriage banned are going to have chaos if they dont legalize it soon. I strongly believe that if two people love eachother then let them do what they want. If any oppurtuity comes up where love is shown then it's just making the world a more loving place.</text>

         <text>I'm Catholic been my whole life and believe same sex marriage should be legal if there is a commandment saying gay people can't be together will someone show me because my 9 years of Catholic school I never heard that one but have been around a lot of people who say gay marriage should be illegal and are Catholic yet break every commandment. Gay people have every right to marry each other just like a straight couple can get divorced (also against the Bible) and remarry as many times as they want we are all the same we are human. I also wanted to say for the fact that it could end civilization as we know it (a ridiculous argument) a lot of gay people adopt or have surrogates so I don't think the end of civilization as we know it is possible.</text>

         <text>I'm con actually not because I think government shouldn't allow it, but I think government should be out of marriage, period.  I believe it is immoral and wrong, but I can't hold others not of my faith to my standards.  I believe that's wrong as well.  I don't see marriage as a right.  I see it as a privilege.  I see it as a social status; a proclamation to the world and society that two people are coming together to start a family and/or love and cherish each other, not to file taxes together.  As nice as it is to be able to file taxes together, it's not far to those gays and lesbians who can't get married, and it's not fair to single people who haven't had any luck finding that right person.  I think government should stay out of marriage and let US decide who we want to commit to.  Just my two cents.  Not saying ya'll are wrong for supporting it.  Just as I'm entitled to my opinion, you are all entitle to your own as well.</text>

         <text>I'm con actually not because I think government shouldn't allow it, but I think government should be out of marriage, period.  I believe it is immoral and wrong, but I can't hold others not of my faith to my standards.  I believe that's wrong as well.  I don't see marriage as a right.  I see it as a privilege.  I see it as a social status; a proclamation to the world and society that two people are coming together to start a family and/or love and cherish each other, not to file taxes together.  As nice as it is to be able to file taxes together, it's not far to those gays and lesbians who can't get married, and it's not fair to single people who haven't had any luck finding that right person.

         <text>I'm con because gay marriage is against the moral rights. I will never agreed with the fact that gay couples adopting children, that is just wrong because those  children will not have the same childhood as normal kids. How about when they go to school and the teacher ask who are the parents he will be like oh! I got two moms or I got two dads. That its just not right because it has always been Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve. The bible does not says that men should marry men or vice versa. It has always been clear to me that the word Marriage it's between Man and Woman. Gay couples can live their crazy and in moral life however they want but will not be allowed to get marry like a heterosexual couple. It is just disgusting seen a man kissing other man or a woman kissing other woman if front children. They should keep themselves in secret.</text>

         <text>I'm pro because it will finally end an age old dispute but not change the reality that every Human is born out of Heterosexuality. Stopping the misuse of the current Constitution of the United States of America by claiming the 5th Amendment has anything to do with this argument or that Government should overstep its responsibility to the People, by the People and for the People. The marriage agreement is between two people but should never be used for the benefit of partners to misuse the current rules and laws relating to Taxation, Health benefits or the restructuring of will laws or any related item set forth by State or Federal Government. The false claims that Heterosexuals are fighting to block same sex marriage is ridiculous. It is not marriage that is the issue it is the blatant misuse of our freedoms. Marriage is and should always be recognized by Humans as a  religious ceremony without Government interpretation.</text>

         <text>If anyone had asked me a few years back I would have been for gay and lesbian rights full tilt, jobs, housing, etc Before we even go there I am not anti-gay/lesbian. My siblings are both lesbian and gay. And I do think the worst of prejudice. I do have to confess though I am not for same sex marriage for several reasons. Number 1 being that they change partners too frequently, it makes a joke of til death do us part. Throw a child in there they are going to have no clue, can you see your 6 year old asking daddy why are you and daddy getting divorced? Not saying hetero sexuals don't break up or get divorced they do but to have it thrown into the mix that they have gay/lesbian parents. Just let's say kids can be very cruel and so can their parents. The third reason for me is I don't enjoy having it shoved down my throat. The more the gay/lesbian communities get the more they push. And go ahead and boo me I don't like that every time I turn around you can't have a conversation or read the paper or an article where gay/lesbian is not thrown in there every third word. Believe me when I say we all know  that you live an alternative lifestyle without you throwing it at us (me) every two minutes.</text>

         <text>If we address gay marriage on the basis of religion then yes it is considered wrong. but fact is no two people are going to have the same identical beliefs. some would say there is no  god and others say there is. I believe there is and he loved and accepted everyone regardless of one's sexual desire and so should we. Yes we do not have to promote gay marriage  neither support it but I strongly feel that if two people want to marry and are the same sex then it really isn't the same as two of opposite sex. Why? Simple reason marriage combines the forms of male and female not just for bearing children but it's a psychological thing.  A guy needs a girl to support him and understand him and listen to his problem; and a female needs a guy to support her and provide for her in ways she cannot provide for herself. Note that these are my views on the topic and I'm allowed to voice an opinion in a respectful way :D But I'm sure I'll have a few silly comments saying Why do you care? I don't if Jenna  Monique want to be together fine. That's their choice in the end we all have to answer to someone after we take our last breath. Also I'll add this just because you choose not to believe in something doesn't mean it's not true.</text>

         <text>If we address gay marriage on the basis of religion then yes it is considered wrong. but fact is no two people are going to have the same identical beliefs. some would say there is no  god and others say there is. I believe there is and he loved and accepted everyone regardless of one's sexual desire and so should we. Yes we do not have to promote gay marriage  neither support it but I strongly feel that if two people want to marry and are the same sex then it really isn't the same as two of opposite sex. Why? Simple reason marriage combines the forms of male and female not just for bearing children but it's a psychological thing.  A guy needs a girl to support him and understand him and listen to his problem; and a female needs a guy to support her and provide for her in ways she cannot provide for herself. Note that these are my views on the topic and I'm allowed to voice an opinion in a respectful way :D But I'm sure I'll have a few silly comments saying Why do you care? I don't if Jenna  Monique want to be together fine. That's their choice in the end we all have to answer to someone after we take our last breath. Also I'll add this just because you choose not to believe in something doesn't mean it's not true.</text>

         <text>In light of our recent celebration of Mother's Day, think about all of the children who can't say Happy Mother's Day, either because of the lack of a mom, or even more pressing, the lack of child. It is not illogical that man + man = no offspring. I agree with a large consensus of people, everyone deserves the right to love who they want; but when did men start loving men? It is a distortion of what real love is. God made a woman for a man. It was never, and I say this with utmost sincerity, Adam and Steve. And maybe you are an evolutionist or a big bang theorist (not sure of the technical name), but that still doesn't subtract from the age-old truth that, no matter how we got here, it has always been a man and a woman in holy matrimony until more recent centuries where people have slowly started distorting this reality in favor of something contemporary and new, like gay marriage.</text>

         <text>In response to the second con for gay marriage, which states that divorce rates are already threatening marriage, and that legalizing gay marriage would only serve to weaken further this institution, it states under Did You Know? that Massachusetts, the first state to do so, legalized gay marriage in 2004. Statistics show the divorce rate dropped 21% between the years 2003 and 2008, giving it the lowest divorce rate in the country. No evidence is given to support the fact that the legalization of gay marriage has ever been recorded to have had a negative effect on this aspect of the institution.   The con also gives statistics regarding the percentage of children born to unwed mothers. It does not, upon shallow  inspection, seem likely that the legalization of gay marriage would affect these numbers, for obvious reasons.  In short, this arguement is a fallacy. They gave no reasons to support the accusation that legalization would harm the institution of marriage.</text>

         <text>In response to the second con for gay marriage, which states that divorce rates are already threatening marriage, and that legalizing gay marriage would only serve to weaken further this institution, it states under Did You Know? that Massachusetts, the first state to do so, legalized gay marriage in 2004. Statistics show the divorce rate dropped 21% between the years 2003 and 2008, giving it the lowest divorce rate in the country. No evidence is given to support the fact that the legalization of gay marriage has ever been recorded to have had a negative effect on this aspect of the institution.   The con also gives statistics regarding the percentage of children born to unwed mothers. It does not, upon shallow  inspection, seem likely that the legalization of gay marriage would affect these numbers, for obvious reasons.  In short, this arguement is a fallacy. They gave no reasons to support the accusation that legalization would harm the institution of marriage.</text>

         <text>In the Oct. 15, 1971 decision Baker v. Nelson (186 KB), the Supreme Court of Minnesota found that The institution of marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the book of Genesis.  Do you want your money going to something only 42% of people in the USA find something that should be legal?  On Dec. 17, 2009, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cost to the federal government of extending employment benefits to same-sex domestic partners of certain federal employees (making no mention of additional costs such as Social Security and inheritance taxes) would be $596 million in mandatory spending and $302 million in discretionary spending between 2010 and 2019. My friends that is a total of $898 million.</text>

The soul of man (created by the creator), invisible to normal human vision because it is comprised of more subtle substance than human flesh, is contacted by the human mother who becomes a conduit, or who touches that (soul) realm (now we know why sex is sacred and so we may understand why some scriptures prescribe severe penalties for RAPE - the victim's soul is interfered with, thereby). Two same-sex people cannot do that ON THEIR OWN. Fertilized egg implants or any type of engineering does not alter the fact that the Mercy of The Creator is NOT extended to them in that regard, nor can they have that type of access.   Now, don't get me wrong.  This is not hate; simply facts as I see them. Therefore it is best to let them continue in their folly, BUT,  they are not to indoctrinate others, especially our children, nor are they to be granted any special rights. They already have the constitution. Let us be careful. Could THIS be a plot to make it  EASIER to conquer mankind by causing us to descend to ungodly considerations and principles?</text>

         <text>It is not possible for a gay couple to enter into a marriage.  Their relationship lacks two key marriage components.  One,  in the marriage of the man and women you have a complete representation of the entire human race.  A gay relationship represents redundancy not completion.  Second, as stated often the very nature of a gay relationship makes it impossible to procreate.  With these two key features missing, marriage is not possible.  Certainly homosexuals can enter in civil unions and should be granted all of the legal rights associated with marriage.</text>

         <text>It is proven that gay marriage can cause no harm. Divorce rates are lower with gay/lesbian couples due to the fact that they havent abused rights of marriage like straight couples have. It's not right to see a man and woman hate something they got into so easily when a man and a man or a woman and a woman can't even be together in holy matrimony yet feel so deeply for one another. It's the american peoples fault that marriage is going to hell, not just gay people.</text>

         <text>It's a human right, not a heterosexual privilege.   The full faith and credit clause of our Constitution states that if one state makes a law, other states have to recognize it. It's kind of like having a driver's license in IL then going to WI, it's valid and just the same. So, in theory if one state legalizes gay marriage and the couples disperse throughout the U.S. every state SHOULD recognize it. I cannot wait until states start losing federal funding over this. It reminds me of the struggles the African Americans went through ( I'm not using that to lessen the intensity but to serve as a comparison.) The whole state's rights issue is surfacing again and it will be interesting to see how our government handles it. Hopefully we don't have the same bigots and hateful people in office so things can fall into place. Separate the church and the state. Marriage has been seen in more recent times as a religious term, even given to atheists. And if all sin is the same in the eyes of god, why is it any different giving homosexuals the ability to use that term? Legalizing gay marriage would increase revenue, stop legal discrimination against the newly created and heavily ostracized minority and enable love to flourish.</text>

So, in theory if one state legalizes gay marriage and the couples disperse throughout the U.S. every state SHOULD recognize it. I cannot wait until states start losing federal funding over this. It reminds me of the struggles the African Americans went through ( I'm not using that to lessen the intensity but to serve as a comparison.) The whole state's rights issue is surfacing again and it will be interesting to see how our government handles it. Hopefully we don't have the same bigots and hateful people in office so things can fall into place. Separate the church and the state. Marriage has been seen in more recent times as a religious term, even given to atheists. And if all sin is the same in the eyes of god, why is it any different giving homosexuals the ability to use that term? Legalizing gay marriage would increase revenue, stop legal discrimination against the newly created and heavily ostracized minority and enable love to flourish.</text>

         <text>Legalizing gay marriage has nothing to do with the church, or it shouldn't. One part of marriage is getting benefits from the other. Many married couples never have children but still get the benefits of marriage, should we take those benefits away because they don't have children? Another is the promise to be with each other for an eternity etc. Marriage is also about being able to celebrate having each other. And last, marriage is about being there for each other. Granting marriage to same-sex couples lets them see eachother in hospitals, make medical desicions for their partner when they are unable to and ensure both of the participants safety. Everyone deserves the right to recive these things in a relationship.  And besides, not every wedding is in a church, plenty of atheists get married, should we ban marriage from them too for not being christian, muslim or jewish (or any other religion)? Contemplate that then look around you, look at your boyfriend/girlfriend and your relatives, some of them might be homosexual. And do they deserve to have the right to happiness as the Constitution states? I think they do.</text>

         <text>Let my ask you this: Who defines marriage? Why should it be illegal to marry someone you love? Did you, who are straight choose to be straight? Being gay is a genetic predisposition and should be considered perfectly natural in society. Instead people get so obsessed with not wanting change and the thought of someone being different from them comes as a threat. Lets make this world a better place, legalize gay marriage. There is nothing it will hurt.</text>

         <text>Love is Love. It's as simple as that. I'm a christian and I believe that Jesus taught us to love others and not judge them. Same-sex marriages should be allowed because marriage is a right that should be granted to all. For those saying they want to strengthen marriage, then why don't we get rid of no-fault divorces? Or if the purpose of marriage is for reproduction, then should we not allow infertile couples or the aging to marry?? (Levy, Robert) Research has already shown that   Massachusetts, which became the first state to legalize gay marriage in 2004, had the lowest divorce rate in the country in 2008. (Procon.org) Honestly, all should be allowed to get married. Rather it be a civil marriage (because civil unions just don't cut it- separate but equal is not legal) or a traditional marriage. Though I do believe that churches should not be forced to marry couples, but all human beings should be allowed to get married.</text>

         <text>Marriage is a privilege granted by the government with many stipulations. Love has never been a factor. Marriage is divided among gender lines, not love lines, because only men and women can reproduce. In a time when many countries are facing below-replacement birth rates, we should be encouraging marriage, not dividing and weakening it.  Gay marriage advocates use emotional rhetoric to bypass the fact that children raised by gays are more likely to be gay themselves. Common sense demands it, and studies prove it. Sexuality is in large part a learned trait, and can be influenced over time just like someone's weight. Furthermore, the (primarily atheist) forces behind gay marriage seek to end marriage completely, since they see it as a religious ideology. This is shown by the low proportion of gay marriages performed and children raised in countries where gay marriage has been legal for some time.   It is not an accident that marriage has been between men and women for all of human history. Gay marriage advocates are not original in their beliefs. Other societies have tried to change marriage to suit their beliefs, and they have either stagnated or failed. More research and less rhetoric is needed in order to make a smart decision.</text>

         <text>Marriage is a union between MAN and WIFE in the eyes of the LORD. Homosexuality is an abomination in our religion, and pushing for same sex marriage is discriminatory against the Christian faith. If this passed, doesn't this undermine the church and the whole concept of marriage in the first place? People seem to forget, marriage is 100% faith related, you wouldn't ask the muslims or hindu's to marry in their holy places, so why should the church be any different? Also, why would homosexuals want to be involved in a religious principle that directly opposes them instinctively, never-mind their right to marry. Homosexuals already have a legal right, why should they ask for more?</text>

People seem to forget, marriage is 100% faith related, you wouldn't ask the muslims or hindu's to marry in their holy places, so why should the church be any different? Also, why would homosexuals want to be involved in a religious principle that directly opposes them instinctively, never-mind their right to marry. Homosexuals already have a legal right, why should they ask for more?</text>

         <text>Marriage is intended for a man and woman. Nothing more. God created Eve for Adam, woman for man. Not man for man or woman for woman. In the Bible, Leviticus 20: 10-21 lists all of the sexually immoral acts. Among that list IS homosexuality. It is an abomination to God. To say He created homosexuality is very very incorrect. Sin is not of God. Marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman and should not be defiled by what is clearly wrong.</text>

         <text>Marriage is not a religious right, it is a civil contract issued by a court. Also, the nation cannot conduct laws solely on religious grounds: that is against the First Amendment (Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,...). America isn't a theocracy and no one's religion should inflict in anyone else's life. I also believe it is blasphemous to conduct God our Lord as hating any person for something no one can alter. Believing God throws gay people to the fires is showing only that you believe they should be. I hope that any person loving another should not be condemned for it, but embraced, and that their partnership is allowed to be recognized by the government even if the public refuses to. God bless the US.</text>

         <text>Marriage isn't the joining of two people who have intentions of raising and nurturing children. It never has been. There have been many married couples whos have not had children. The fact of the matter is that marriage is the joining of two hearts that can't seem to live without each other. Straight couples do this, and they often get divorced after swearing to love each other until death do them part. If straight couples can attempt to work out a marriage, why can't homosexual couple have this same privilege? After all, you're either gay, or you're not. You don't choose to be gay, but no one spitefully causes you to be gay either. Love knows no bounds. It can't hear, speak, touch, smell, or taste. It doesn't discriminate like many of our own kind. Keep in mind that I'm heterosexual. I love women and their bodies. If I can say that, and then tell you that hating on gays and their right to be married is wrong, then maybe it will open your eyes and your minds a little more.As for people who argue that gay marriage will destroy the boundaries between state and religion, that boundary shouln't even exist. The government should stand alone. The church should have absolutely no say in what happens in politics.</text>

         <text>Marriage isn't the joining of two people who have intentions of raising and nurturing children. It never has been. There have been many married couples whos have not had children. The fact of the matter is that marriage is the joining of two hearts that can't seem to live without each other. Straight couples do this, and they often get divorced after swearing to love each other until death do them part. If straight couples can attempt to work out a marriage, why can't homosexual couple have this same privilege? After all, you're either gay, or you're not. You don't choose to be gay, but no one spitefully causes you to be gay either. Love knows no bounds. It can't hear, speak, touch, smell, or taste. It doesn't discriminate like many of our own kind. Keep in mind that I'm heterosexual. I love women and their bodies. If I can say that, and then tell you that hating on gays and their right to be married is wrong, then maybe it will open your eyes and your minds a little more.As for people who argue that gay marriage will destroy the boundaries between state and religion, that boundary shouln't even exist. The government should stand alone. The church should have absolutely no say in what happens in politics.</text>

         <text>Marriage:Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses. If this were to be looked at as a gay marriage situation, the only thing that would really upset me is the 'found a family' part. It angers me how everyone is putting words into the mouths of kids by saying Oh they'll be fine or It won't effect. Do you even know how it feels?! My mom 'turned lesbian' about two years after my parents divorced. I was about 15 years old. Since she wanted to live up to her selfish ways of being a 'guy trapped in a woman's body' I had no one to guide me through my teenage years of being a girl. I had to figure everything out on my own and aside from that, live with the fear of people finding out who my mom was. The few people that did find out began bullying me. Now my little 11 year old sister is going through the same hell. For all you blind people, I WASN'T FINE, I WAS SUICIDAL. The only thing that stopped me was the idea of my sister hanging from that cord after me</text>

         <text>My disagreement lies more with the argument for altering the existing union of male/female marriage, which is based on a falacy that homosexuals are somehow legally restricted in their right to engage in marriage, as defined between man and woman. In fact, it is their sexual orientation that ultimately prevents their desire to participate in traditional marriage (not some law or form of discrimination toward homosexuals). There are actually many self proclaimed homosexuals who do currently engage in traditional marriage (and raise families, etc.) This is proof that homosexuals are not restricted from marriage (as defined between man and woman) I truly believe that the powers behind the cause to re-define marriage stem from a stronger desire to attack a religious institution that does not support homosexuality, rather than a desire to achieve the same benefits as marriage for same sex couples. Sexual orientation is not currently and should never be a factor in legal unions for same sex or opposite sex couples.</text>

         <text>My disagreement lies more with the argument for altering the existing union of male/female marriage, which is based on a falacy that homosexuals are somehow legally restricted in their right to engage in marriage, as defined between man and woman. In fact, it is their sexual orientation that ultimately prevents their desire to participate in traditional marriage (not some law or form of discrimination toward homosexuals). There are actually many self proclaimed homosexuals who do currently engage in traditional marriage (and raise families, etc.) This is proof that homosexuals are not restricted from marriage (as defined between man and woman) I truly believe that the powers behind the cause to re-define marriage stem from a stronger desire to attack a religious institution that does not support homosexuality, rather than a desire to achieve the same benefits as marriage for same sex couples. Sexual orientation is not currently and should never be a factor in legal unions for same sex or opposite sex couples.</text>

         <text>No where in the United States Constitution is there any restriction on who should and shouldn't marry; the sanctity of marriage, according to the Constitution, is not defined as a union between a man and a woman. All definitions of sanctity of marriage is based off of religious beliefs, not governmental precautions. Love is still the same when between a same-sex couple. Gays and lesbians are still citizens, have friends and families, some attend chuch and lead lives that heterosexuals would lead. What seperates a gay or lesbian from the rest of society when they do the same exact things as us, and the only difference may be their choice of life partners? Who are we to determine what's best for others? We don't know every single same-sex couple, their pasts or life stories, who are we to determine their fate? Gay people worship Jesus, and if he hadn't of wanted anyone to like people of the same sex, then he would of made them differently. Let people determine how they spend their lives in the afterlife. We lead our own lives, let gays and lesbians lead their own. Their not hurting us, we shouldn't hurt them. Whatever you believe is your business; don't force it down anyone elses throats. Worry about yourself; leave others be.</text>

         <text>No, gay marriage will never be legal ,marriage is between a MAN and a WOMAN. However  homosexual couples deserve the same benefits that a MAN and a WOMAN have. The solution is very simple : CIVIL UNION. A CIVIL UNION has the same benefits of tradicional marriage ,without calling it marriage, and i belive it is the only valid solution to this never ending argument that is gay marriage.  This is not about gay or straight its about respect .  RESPECT for the founding fathers , the constitution ,religion , marriage and peoples rights.</text>

         <text>No, gay marriage will never be legal ,marriage is between a MAN and a WOMAN. However  homosexual couples deserve the same benefits that a MAN and a WOMAN have. The solution is very simple : CIVIL UNION. A CIVIL UNION has the same benefits of tradicional marriage ,without calling it marriage, and i belive it is the only valid solution to this never ending argument that is gay marriage.  This is not about gay or straight its about respect .  RESPECT for the founding fathers , the constitution ,religion , marriage and peoples rights.</text>

         <text>Of course gay marriage should be legal.  It is clearly discrimination to not allow gay couples to legally get married.    There are two aspects of marriage:  the state, and the church.    The only thing our courts can legalize is state sanctioned marriage and they should do it ASAP.  A loving gay couple should be entitled to all the rights of marriage.  The other aspect of marriage is the church.  The state can never compel any church to marry a gay couple.  Plain and simple.  The argument that legalizing gay marriage will destroy traditional religious marriages is a red herring.  It can never happen.  Yet this argument is used to scare the general public into not supporting gay marriage.    Do not fall for it!</text>

         <text>One of my objections to same sex marriages is that it may give those people monetary advantages intended for normal married couples.  The prime example is that they would receive a reduction of their Federal, and probably State, income taxes if allowed file jointly.  If you go back and study the Congressional committee reports that established the Federal reduction of taxes for married couples, I believe you will find that it was based on the premise that a wife during her child bearing and rearing years will have reduced ability to contribute to the family income.  This may also apply to other government programs.  Assuming that the average voter would object to the reduction for same sex marriages, this may be an argument to oppose such marriages.

         <text>People deserve the freedom to live their lives however fits them. First, according to our current findings in science being homosexual is in no way a malfunction or an illness. It's a natural occurence in society. Second, there's absolutely no logical reason why it shouldn't be legal. I glanced over to the con section of this page and all I see is God God God...Bible this and that. Well, did it ever occur to you that not everyone believes in God or the bible???? Oh no, I'm sorry, the world should revolve around your beliefs. There are people who may see your beliefs as damaging to society as legalizing gay marriage but I don't see them protesting your ignorance and trying to remove your right of practicing whatever you do and choose to believe.   People should mind their own business and allow others to live their lives their way. Instead of wasting your time trying to stop others from being happy take a look in the mirror and ask yourself what makes you happy and pursue that...period.</text>

         <text>People need to realize that gay marriage is wrong. Not only that, but it is against God's way of marriage. Even if you do not believe in him, you must know that gay marriage will only split society in half between those who supported it and those who do not. Even now we are split upon the issue. People of homosexuality do not need to marry, they should be happy with what they already have. Marriage should only be allowed to those of heterosexuality. Their practice is wrong and needs to cease to exist from American society.</text>

My faith and i strongly believe that it marriage is between only a man and a women but that's just my opinion but i am now a king so i cant force my beliefs on anyone. honestly in the future i do believe that they way America is becoming more open minded to things that gay marriage will be legal but if it doesn't happen right now don't cry wolf and throw a fit your time is coming just not now.</text>

         <text>Perhaps we should look at the state interest in gay marriage. Why would the state want to marry two homosexuals? How does it serve the state? It doesn't, therefore it does not serve state interest. Now perhaps we should look at the public health catastrophe among gay men. Or perhaps the psychological problems involved with children being raised under a homosexual marriage. There are many problems with homosexuality outside of religion. Think about the bigger picture. Instead of thinking about the effects of the straight community on homosexuals, think about how homosexuals may be effecting the straight community. Homosexuals ask for fairness and to not be messed with by the straights. The straights ask for the same thing: not to be messed with by the homosexuals. This is a two way street folks, stop blocking one direction of traffic for your own personal benefits. Being selfish is not a good thing, we are taught that from an early age, and at least everyone does agree on that. So I implore you, please share the road a little.</text>

         <text>Public support of marriage is originally for the purpose of raising of children, not supporting adult hedonism and licentiousness. Why should public resources support typical LGBTQ behaviors such as sodomy, abortion, disease proliferation, and pornography? Why should the public support any LGBTQ Diversity schemes? LGBTQ are well known leaders of abortion on demand. It is fairly ridiculous to grant a marriage license, originally public support for raising children, to people that promote infanticide. With all of the recent news of homosexual child molestation and multi-drug resistant diseses associated with HIV infection, it makes zero sense to support LGBTQ behaviors. The public puts prostitutes in jail for doing less vile things than LGBTQ. Why grant a license for licentiousness?</text>

         <text>Regardless of what laws pass as our nation heads down the road of descending morals, marriage will always be sacred between a man and a woman. It is the Lords plan for this earth and has been since the beginning of time. Two men or two women cannot procreate, it's that basic. We can only hope that individuals who are in this lifestyle will get this help they truly need.

         <text>Separation of church and state. Everyone should be allowed to get a civil union (as in Europe) and then go to the church and get married. Marriage is a sacrament not a legal contract. The sanctity of marriage does not exist; the history of marriage proves that. Read a book other than the bible. America was founded on the flight from religious oppression... not to create oppression be christians. Your love for god is between you and god and involves no one else.

         <text>So I want to know whats next. Are we going to get marriage for the guy who wants to marry his pet monkey? Animal rights activist will probably say your discriminating by not letting him marry. Hey how is he different? He's just as loving as anybody else? He should get the same rights as everyone else. Love is love and he was born that way, so don't be so hateful qouting your Bible saying why it's wrong. So what, he and his monkey can't have kids theyre just as loving and can raise kids like anyone else... Anyone get my drift? Does this argument sound familiar? It should its used for homosexuality and will probably be used in the future for bestiality? what do homosexuality and bestiality have in common? Theyre both unnatural. You can tell by the fact that they both can not produce offspring. If Im wrong someone tell me, sincerly, why bestiality is wrong and homosexuality is right.</text>

         <text>So much talk about discrimination and equal rights, religion and constitutional freedom when what this issue is about is right verses wrong. Is it wrong for a 45 year old man to have sex with a 10 year old boy? Or is that a personal choice that someone should be allowed to make? Is it wrong for a satanist to sacrifice animals in worship of Satan? Or should he have freedom to practice his religion? Is it wrong for two people to have homosexual intercourse (it was in the United States until 1970)? Or should the entire country be forced to accept it as normal, even honorable? Laws are about what we as a society value or consider to be wrong. A majority of the people in this country consider it to be wrong because deep down inside we all know it is not natural. Yet those who choose to practice it want to force all of the rest of us to honor them. That is what I think is wrong about legalizing gay marriage. Society should not be forced to accept everything everyone wants to do as natural. Yet this is the direction that gay marriage is taking us.</text>

         <text>So much talk about discrimination and equal rights, religion and constitutional freedom when what this issue is about is right verses wrong. Is it wrong for a 45 year old man to have sex with a 10 year old boy? Or is that a personal choice that someone should be allowed to make? Is it wrong for a satanist to sacrifice animals in worship of Satan? Or should he have freedom to practice his religion? Is it wrong for two people to have homosexual intercourse (it was in the United States until 1970)? Or should the entire country be forced to accept it as normal, even honorable? Laws are about what we as a society value or consider to be wrong. A majority of the people in this country consider it to be wrong because deep down inside we all know it is not natural. Yet those who choose to practice it want to force all of the rest of us to honor them. That is what I think is wrong about legalizing gay marriage. Society should not be forced to accept everything everyone wants to do as natural. Yet this is the direction that gay marriage is taking us.</text>

         <text>Thank you God   Gays say it is the same, let's examine that statement. Man + women = man and women ok man + man + man and man not the same. Woman + woman + woman and woman not the same. Why do gay people always flaunt their gayness they want you to believe that they are a race, ethnic group which they are neither. The want the right to destroy other people's children with their doctrine. The gays want  gay doctrine taught in schools. Why do school age children need to be worried about such perversion.  Innocent children only see the truth and will speak on it now the gay left is pushing the BULLYING agenda, because they do not want to hear that they are wrong. Gay people always want to tell the world I'm gay, why. Hetrosexuals don't go around saying I'm straight all day  Gay people say it is the 21st century well what was wrong in the 1st century is still wrong today. If we were all gay we would not be reproducing. So it would only end in the death of mankind. Gays have only hurt our country with divisions.  I hate no one, nor is this about hate it's about not believeing the lie.God Bless all and America read the Bible gay people it will become clear</text>

         <text>The Bible clearly states that marriage is defined as one man, and one woman. Also, discrimination against same sex couples isn't against them personally, but against what they stand for, which is a blatent abuse of civil rights. The founding fathers never meant for these articles to be used in the way they are. And, as far as same sex marriage in history, it's clearly shown as a corruption of what was made perfect by God in every way.</text>

         <text>The Con side has very weak arguments 1.  The argument that churches will be forced to do anything is absolutely false.   Many churches support marriage equality.   2.  Outdated and off-point references:  The Supreme Ct decision in 1971 is outdated and misapplied, as it was only a summary dismissal;  the reference [Child Dev. 203 73(3)] on sexual activity of girls who are raised without fathers is misapplied -- it doesn't anything about two parent gay families.  Using the misapplied logic:  two gay men raising daughters would be ideal to delay sexual activity of teenage girls! 3.  Con point 3 about divorce is directly contradicted by data. 4.  The slippery slope scare ignores the real harms that come from polygamy, etc.  There are no real harms in extending equality for two consenting adults.   5.  Most ridiculous argument: con point 5 - People should not have their tax dollars used to support something they find wrong, oh like false-premise preemptive war?</text>

         <text>The Con side has very weak arguments 1.  The argument that churches will be forced to do anything is absolutely false.   Many churches support marriage equality.   2.  Outdated and off-point references:  The Supreme Ct decision in 1971 is outdated and misapplied, as it was only a summary dismissal;  the reference [Child Dev. 203 73(3)] on sexual activity of girls who are raised without fathers is misapplied -- it doesn't anything about two parent gay families.  Using the misapplied logic:  two gay men raising daughters would be ideal to delay sexual activity of teenage girls! 3.  Con point 3 about divorce is directly contradicted by data. 4.  The slippery slope scare ignores the real harms that come from polygamy, etc.  There are no real harms in extending equality for two consenting adults.   5.  Most ridiculous argument: con point 5 - People should not have their tax dollars used to support something they find wrong, oh like false-premise preemptive war?</text>

         <text>The State gives married people benefits, joint ownership, hospital visitation rights, travel privileges, and many other rights for two people in a loving mutual relationship. People do not choose their gender, people do not choose who they love. The heart chooses who people love. Nobody in the womb says Excuse me Mrs. X Chromosome, please stay away and give me a Y or vice-versa. Gender is out of our control at birth and remains so until people can become trans. To deny people to marry the person they love and give rights to some people but not others is discriminatory hence immoral. To those who say straight marriage is the only traditional institution than why has homosexuality existed in numerous cultures forever alongside heterosexuality in peace and harmony for thousands of years? Also, if you are going to take the Christian path, The Bible never mentions that Jesus condemned homosexuality, and said that all the laws hang on two principles, love your god, and love your neighbor, and every law for Christians must follow one of these. Denying Homosexuality is breaking the second. By denying gay marriage as a Christian people are not loving your neighbor and breaking the highest commandment of Christianity.</text>

         <text>The arguments against are shaky, unfounded, or self-contradicting.  When they say that marriage is a religious union, what about all those atheist couples?  Benjamin Franklin had said, in writing, that religion and government should be separated. They clearly stated that much of the historical purpose of marriage was procreation, implying that married couples who are physically incapable of, or choose not to, have children are not valid. And someone explain to me the correlation between a man and a man or a woman and a woman getting married and, say, a woman and a horse?  There is no connection.  There aren't many, if any, valid and/or strong arguments against gay marriage. One additional thing to add is that, even though the United States Constitution does not directly state a right to privacy, Framers such as James Madison say that government cannot invade the privacy of an individual without good reason.

         <text>The fact is religious beliefs are not a valid source for making law. When the Founders wrote the nation's Constitution, they specified that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. (Article 6, section 3) This provision was radical in its day-- giving equal citizenship to believers and non-believers alike. They wanted to ensure that no religion could make the claim of being the official, national religion, such as England had.  No individual or congregation will have to give up their beliefs by allow homosexuals to marry. If a church does not want to marry homosexuals then they NEVER have to. Having separate terms, marriage for heterosexuals and civil unions for homosexuals will only open the door for segregation on paper. Examples would be gays paying more in tax or health insurance policies, approval or denial of access to partners benefits like SS, disability. Separate is NOT equal!</text>

         <text>The ideal setting in which to raise a child is with a Mother and a Father. The human genome has been mapped and no gay gene was found. Any reputable biologist, psychologist, et al., will tell you there are variety of reasons why people engage in homosexual behavior. Homosexuals shouldn't be absued, demeaned, etc. However, most homosexuals do not actually want to get married. There are already many benefits afforded to homosexuals (domestic partnership benefits, they're allowed to enter into contracts, etc.). It appears that the real reason this is being pushed as some urgent civil right is not because of a real need or desire, but a desire to elevate homosexual behavior with that of (universally accepted) male and female union. Children deserve to be raised in healthy environments. People deserve to hear the truth about the unhealthy effects (physcial and emotional) of homosexual behavior. Lastly, God does exist, His Word is true and if this nation or any other turns its back on Him, we are doomed (whether any of you like it, believe it, or want to believe it). Thank you for reading this. Thank God for the freedom to say what we believe. If you don't agree with me on this, let's agree that's great that we can say what we think</text>

         <text>The issue of marriage equality should not even be an issue.   Since this appears to be a question of politics (although that's ridiculous since it's much too personal for that) let's talk politics. This country was founded on the basis of equal rights, meaning gender equality, racial equality, social equality, and yes, LGBT+ equality. This country needs to realize that if we deny one class of citizens their rights, we ourselves can never, ever use our constitution as a valid argument, as we've already crossed it.  Since people often seem to bring religion into the picture, may I remind you of the separation of church and state. You can't bring someone's religious opinion into an issue like this.  Finally, let's just talk common sense. People say that love has no limits. Then why are we limiting it? Marriage is the ultimate sign of a loving, committed relationship, so no one should be barred from that.</text>

         <text>The joining of two same sex individuals is really disgusting (; why? cause it just is, what do you expect two guys to do? and what about two females? Marriage is not about making children or a commitment to god it's about saying you love someone so much to commit yourself to ONE individual for life. Gay marriage will not decrease divorce rates cause people (both gay non gay ) will change over time and stuff will annoy you in the long run. People are stupid to think it's bigotry to deny the right of marriage to two men why? is it bigotry to deny rights to a white kid asking for a black scholarships ? nope cause the kid's white not black.  gays say they are only asking for equal rights get it through your heads guys; gays  straights are not equal people gay men straight men have diff brain functions; so how is granting gay marriage to two dudes equal rights? How bout you guys stop freaking arguing over gay rights  focus on human rights, kids in poverty getting abused, or the climbing unemployment rates . oh don't say love is love dude? really?

         <text>The joining of two same sex individuals is really disgusting (; why? cause it just is, what do you expect two guys to do? and what about two females? Marriage is not about making children or a commitment to god it's about saying you love someone so much to commit yourself to ONE individual for life. Gay marriage will not decrease divorce rates cause people (both gay non gay ) will change over time and stuff will annoy you in the long run. People are stupid to think it's bigotry to deny the right of marriage to two men why? is it bigotry to deny rights to a white kid asking for a black scholarships ? nope cause the kid's white not black.  gays say they are only asking for equal rights get it through your heads guys; gays  straights are not equal people gay men straight men have diff brain functions; so how is granting gay marriage to two dudes equal rights? How bout you guys stop freaking arguing over gay rights  focus on human rights, kids in poverty getting abused, or the climbing unemployment rates . oh don't say love is love dude? really?

         <text>The traditional marriage that is held in such high esteem is a relatively recent construct, perhaps 100 years old.  Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.  And, to those who might be so concerned:  of the 34 kids that I know (in same-sex homes), 4 are Gay and 2 are lesbians.  That seems to fit within the accepted percentages.  The argument that Gays are mentally disordered is too specious for words.  In the developed world, there is neither a legitimate Medical nor Psychiatric association that would agree with that claim.  The statement from T. Hansen about [t]he accumulated wisdom of 5000 years is germane to nothing.  The social, legal and/or religious definitions of and practices of marriage have varied widely over time.  Each society, each generation has defined the concept of marriage to fit its own needs.  The slippery slope arguments is one of the oldest chestnuts to cause confusion and install fear and doubt.  The cited outcomes of same-sex marriage border on preposterous and inflammatory.  No reasonable person could possibly follow the inane blathering.  Finally, going back to the earliest extant Hebrew Torah, I am absolutely unable to find any text in which God says to Adam and Eve, Okay, first you guys get married and then you be fruitful and multiply.

         <text>There is no valid reason to deny homosexual's the right to marry. Personal opinion is not a valid reason. The Bible is not a valid reason.

         <text>There isnt anything wrong with being gay it isnt a choice its what you truly are noyone will force anyone to be gay. Most of the time people become gay due to rape or bullying which is something that needs to stop bullying is a big controversial issue in this state. Same sex marriage should be legalized everyone has the right to marry who they love. For example if u were straight and you could never marry your lover wouldnt that bother you too you would do the exactly same thing the other gay protestants are doing. If gay mariages are legal all over the world there will always be love and peace too go around maybe less crime all gays are trying to show you can marry anyone you love man or woman. This might interfere with the constitutional rights but the constitution does say that all the people have rights and liberty. Which means that same sex marriage can be legal and should be due to the process of law. Gay marriages will be legal it will make a change in this world its just the peoples choice to accept this change.</text>

         <text>There should not be an argument over whether or not gay marriage should be legal. Whether you are gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, transexual, or anything else, you are a human being. According to the United States Declaration of Independence, all men are created equal and citizens of the United States are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. If all are created equal, then everyone should have the right to marry who they love. Marriage is part of the pursuit of happiness for many people, and if a gay person wants to get married, they should be able to. There are no legal reasons why two homosexual people should not be allowed to marry, only religious ones (that I know of: if I'm wrong, please tell me! I actually want to know!) and there is supposed to be a separation of church and state in our country. *I know that the Declaration quote is overused x1000, but it's 100% true.</text>

         <text>There should not be an argument over whether or not gay marriage should be legal. Whether you are gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, transexual, or anything else, you are a human being. According to the United States Declaration of Independence, all men are created equal and citizens of the United States are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. If all are created equal, then everyone should have the right to marry who they love. Marriage is part of the pursuit of happiness for many people, and if a gay person wants to get married, they should be able to. There are no legal reasons why two homosexual people should not be allowed to marry, only religious ones (that I know of: if I'm wrong, please tell me! I actually want to know!) and there is supposed to be a separation of church and state in our country. *I know that the Declaration quote is overused x1000, but it's 100% true.</text>

         <text>These are boys and girls that have been planning weddings since they were kids. These are boys and girls who have already been tortured in the hallways of schools. These are the boys and girls who ate their lunch at a table by themselves. These are the boys and girls who have wondered why they're even living. These are the boys and girls who have struggled with identity the most. These are boys and girls who's religious family/friends have turned them down and hated them. These are boys and girls who have had to hide who they really are from society. These are boys and girls who have to stop being in love as soon as they walk out the door. The least we can do is let them marry.  I can't help but notice that all the arguments on the CON side, are religious or say that it's wrong because they can't reproduce.  Well, news flash, my friends; these people obviously don't believe in the bible, and, chances are, aren't going to.  And what about infertile couples? Besides, marriage isn't about kids. There are so many couples that end up not having kids.</text>

         <text>This isn't a question of shaking a finger at the Anti gay Christian community and saying they're not entitled to their beliefs, as they so often think. If one wants to take the bible as literal and believe that homosexuality is wrong, then that is their own personal right. What is NOT their right is using their religion and beliefs in order to back a political stand preventing two people from being recognized by their government as a married couple. I hate to be a cliche, but I've yet to hear a good rebuttle for this argument, but there are so many things in the bible that, if practiced today, would seem horrifying and wrong in a modern society. What gives Christians their own divine right to differentiate between what is still acceptable and what is not? You either believe in the Bible and all of its words, or you accept and understand that modernization is natural. It is NOT giving up on your orginal beliefs and morals, nor is it denying your love for God.  Knowing myself as a spiritual person who believes in God, and above all in love, I find it sickening to use ones beliefs to back up your own hate.</text>

         <text>This same sex marriage term is destroying the true MEANING of marriage. Did you guys know that gay couples are actually prone to get more diseases than non-gay couples..?...so just take a chance and look at the future after 20 years, the population of this world will soon decrease. SO...WHY destroy the meaning of marriage when you guys know that it WILL lead into disaster later on in the future. And even IF you're born gay...I would definitely encourage you (with all due respect) to use your brains and   take pills to decrease or increase your no. of hormones. Being gay can seriously destroy the whole concept and the TRUE meaning of marriage. Can you produce your OWN biological babies on your own if youre married with the same sex person?..OF course you CAN'T!.. and even if you adopted a kid...well you should understand and consider how she/he would feel, having gay parents. So please, with all due respect...see the future before you make any progress now..before it's too late.</text>

         <text>This same sex marriage term is destroying the true MEANING of marriage. Did you guys know that gay couples are actually prone to get more diseases than non-gay couples..?...so just take a chance and look at the future after 20 years, the population of this world will soon decrease. SO...WHY destroy the meaning of marriage when you guys know that it WILL lead into disaster later on in the future. And even IF you're born gay...I would definitely encourage you (with all due respect) to use your brains and   take pills to decrease or increase your no. of hormones. Being gay can seriously destroy the whole concept and the TRUE meaning of marriage. Can you produce your OWN biological babies on your own if youre married with the same sex person?..OF course you CAN'T!.. and even if you adopted a kid...well you should understand and consider how she/he would feel, having gay parents. So please, with all due respect...see the future before you make any progress now..before it's too late.</text>

         <text>To say that allowing gay marriage will eventually lead to allowing people to marry animals is ridiculous. For one, people are people, no matter what the sexual preference. And animals wouldn't even be able to sign marriage papers! Many say that it is unnatural. So are the clothes you wear, and most of the things you use in every day life. Some say that it's against their religion. Getting mad at someone for going against your religion is like getting upset with someone for eating a donut because you're on a diet. The Bible bans shaving, gossip, football, mixing fabrics, eating pork and lobster, and so many other things. You can't just pick and choose what to follow. Another argument would be that children need a mother and father. What about all the single parents that raise their kids? Yes, only a man and woman can reproduce, but some marriages that isn't an option. Should we ban infertile and elderly marriages too? And allowing gay marriage won't turn anyone gay just like being around tall people doesn't make you grow. The bottom line is that everyone deserves to be treated equal and fair. Gay marriage will not harm anyone, and there isn't ONE valid argument against it.</text>

         <text>Unless... two gay people can create a life, which is why we are here as two opposing sexes. According to the gays, there should be one sex here on the earth. OR .. better yet.. what if the world consisted on only gay people?  There would be no children. Is that normal? Is this what God intended?   It is not natural and normal to bbe gay. It is a handicap.It is a chemical imballance. OR.. a choice. A handicap is a defect that can't be helped.However.. no one says this. That leads me to believe it is a choice then. Children need both opposing sexes. Unless.. the gays plan to re write the child care books on children's natural development.  Children are a sponge. Children will pick up on the abnormality of having two of the same sex parents which is not normal. For the gays to pretend their kind is normal is abnormal and society is starting to buy into it.</text>

         <text>Well'if we start legalizing gay marriage,that would be one step forward to integrating them into mainstream society.It would lead to less discrimination against them and to view them as natural. Well, that is exactly what would be wrong with this.  We tell our children that it is right to be gay,that most certainly shatters the pillars of society anywhere and everywhere.And let us also consider the repercussions-I live in India,where there was little to no of this stuff until a few years ago.Now, thanks to the pretentious tolerance that the west is showing,gay culture is booming out here as well.  Yet it does not have as much momentum as in the west,simply because of social stigma (which is essential,and extremely low divorce rates are a proof). It may not be anyone's business who a man sleeps with in the privacy of his home,but viewing it as natural or normal will destroy how we view ourselves in context to others.Next time a child goes to his locker room,you cannot be sure what he is going to face or feel.  10 year olds having a sleepover can perceive this as normal,then there is no telling where we can end up. Change for the sake of change is unnecessary and dangerous...</text>

It may not be anyone's business who a man sleeps with in the privacy of his home,but viewing it as natural or normal will destroy how we view ourselves in context to others.Next time a child goes to his locker room,you cannot be sure what he is going to face or feel.  10 year olds having a sleepover can perceive this as normal,then there is no telling where we can end up. Change for the sake of change is unnecessary and dangerous...</text>

         <text>Well'if we start legalizing gay marriage,that would be one step forward to integrating them into mainstream society.It would lead to less discrimination against them and to view them as natural. Well, that is exactly what would be wrong with this.  We tell our children that it is right to be gay,that most certainly shatters the pillars of society anywhere and everywhere.And let us also consider the repercussions-I live in India,where there was little to no of this stuff until a few years ago.Now, thanks to the pretentious tolerance that the west is showing,gay culture is booming out here as well.

         <text>Whether one is homosexual or heterosexual is not due to any learned response.  Both homosexuals and heterosexuals are what they are because nature made them so.  All persons should be treated as human beings. No person should be oppressed simply because that person is different or thinks differently than another person.  The real reason that some people want the14th Amendment repealed, is because treating people equally doesn't fit, Their  Freedom of Religion.  All humans, whether believers or non-believers, deserve the same treatment.  Churches that recognize homosexual marriage are excersing their Freedom of Religion just as much as Churches that do not recognize homosexual marriage.  The U. S.Constitution and several State Constitutions say both concepts are in fact protected Freedom of Religion, and cannot be expressed in a manner that makes one concept superior to the other.  Some of these Constitutions say this expressly, and some imply it through Construction and implication, which is a necessary and proper way to interpret all of those Constitutions.  Making homosexual marriage a moral issue makes it a to be of the Pharisees and Sadduccees that I must be 10 times more righteous than to get to the Kingdom of Heaven.</text>

         <text>Why should two people be denied marriage just because of their sexuality? Have people grown that shallow? I look at the Con comments and they make me sick. You are actually going to hide behind religion. Last time I checked marriage was for people who are in love not just between a man and woman. Why should a LESBIAN be miserable in a marriage just because they cant get married to the one they love. You people are promoting cheating and crumbling marriage. All you want to do is discriminate against the gays because we are what you call HAPPY, :D we love people for what is in the inside and not just what they have on the outside.  As for your infomation im happy ENGAGED to my girlfriend and we are getting married rather you close minded people like it or not. By the way, one day you guys will loose and it will be legal in the U.S. I mean its legal for gays to be in the military whats stopping the states from legalizing it. Personally not everybody believes in the Bible or any religion. So why deny people marriage just because a selected few think its immoral.

         <text>Why should two people be denied marriage just because of their sexuality? Have people grown that shallow? I look at the Con comments and they make me sick. You are actually going to hide behind religion. Last time I checked marriage was for people who are in love not just between a man and woman. Why should a LESBIAN be miserable in a marriage just because they cant get married to the one they love. You people are promoting cheating and crumbling marriage. All you want to do is discriminate against the gays because we are what you call HAPPY, :D we love people for what is in the inside and not just what they have on the outside.  As for your infomation im happy ENGAGED to my girlfriend and we are getting married rather you close minded people like it or not. By the way, one day you guys will loose and it will be legal in the U.S. I mean its legal for gays to be in the military whats stopping the states from legalizing it. Personally not everybody believes in the Bible or any religion. So why deny people marriage just because a selected few think its immoral. Whats immoral in discrimination and thats whats you are doing</text>

         <text>Yes! Of course it should be legal! It doesn't hurt anyone at all! Why are people so against it? I want to get married to my future husband, but society is not taking too kindly to it. It doesn't affect anyone at all! All it does is make two people of the same sex happy. We are fighting to get this right to marry who we wish! Straight people take this freedom for granted, and have a high divorce rate! So, if they can be happy, why can't we be? I want to marry my fiance, but my state won't allow me to. This is not fair to me and my fiance at all! Marriage and gay marriage are the same thing! The only difference is that marriage is for a man and a woman, and gay marriage is for two men or two women. That is the only difference! People need to get over their homophobia, Bible thumping ways of thinking and allow us this happiness! I don't hate straight people, but I think those who are against it should reconsider why they feel this way. Religion is a choice, sexuality is not. Get that through your heads! Thank you!</text>

         <text>Yes, very much it should be allowed. Why do we have to force people who can't comply with straight marriage to do so? To those who are against it, what if the law didn't allow it, or for the religious types, what if the bible or whatever said it is wrong for a man to be with a woman, and the way to go, was for a man to be with a man. Could you people change and/or conform to that standard? If not, why should we force LGBT people to conform to that, right? After all, I bet alot of the antis are probably that, and are either brainwashed or secretly are ashamed of who they are, such as the case with Ted Haggard. Why do we have to force someone to comply with the standards of something frivolous, and absolutely ridiculous as marriage. Marriage is marriage, whether traditional or same sex. People fall in love with who they fall in love with. Hey, you don't have to attend their weddings, and I think that is probably what is making alot of people against it. They won't invite you, so don't worry about it, Don't flatter yourselves thinking that. To the LGBT people out there, I support your right to wed.</text>

         <text>first let me say that our government should make no laws for nor against our bedroom preferences. This should never be a legal matter. I will soon be celebrating the 25th year of my SACRED wedding vows. Gay marrige is NOT sacerd.   Marriage is an institution for building families, and not for the soul purpose of tax credits or bed room choices.Ggay marriage is no more legitement than a pedifile wanting to marry a 10 yr. boy.  I have no problem with homosexuality,nor love of all human kind, but bed room choices are best left to the ideals of each individual and not the misgivings of politians.I do not think that homosexuals fully understand  that if it were not for their hetrosexual mother AND father that they would not even exist to create this discusion.  If you choose to be gay thats fine with me, Just don`t belittle my 24 yr wedding vows by forcing your opions on me.</text>

         <text>gsy marriage is not harming anyone, they need to mind there own business and realize that the divorce rate for heterosexual couples is nearly 50% if not more! so maybe straight people should not be allowed to get married. just a thoght. This is how all drama and fights begin because people wana nose there way into others lives when they have no right to do so. The world will not be destroyed because a couple of the same sex chooses to be together. we need to stop making them feel alienated becasue they are human beings too.</text>

         <text>i believe gays should get married because of spousal rights, equality, and religion. Gays should get married because marriage confers many rights, protections, and benefits. (legal and practical) such as tax benefits, estate planning benefits, government benefits, family benefits, employment benefits, medical benefits, death benefits, family benefits, etc. Gays should get married because of equality. Gays should be treated equally. I  feel as though if you're against gay marriage you shouldn't marry your heterosexual partner. One reason people may oppose gay marriage is for religious reasons. Because the bible condemns homosexuality as an immoral and unnatural sin. and marriage is a religious thing Even though homosexuality MIGHT be a sin, it's not greater than any other sin. My point is, in the bible it also says having sex before marriage is a sin and lying is a sin.. how come they haven't put a law on those sins?  God loves everyone, if god really thought homosexuality was sin why did he create them? I strongly am for gay marriage</text>

         <text>i believe gays should get married because of spousal rights, equality, and religion. Gays should get married because marriage confers many rights, protections, and benefits. (legal and practical) such as tax benefits, estate planning benefits, government benefits, family benefits, employment benefits, medical benefits, death benefits, family benefits, etc. Gays should get married because of equality. Gays should be treated equally. I  feel as though if you're against gay marriage you shouldn't marry your heterosexual partner. One reason people may oppose gay marriage is for religious reasons. Because the bible condemns homosexuality as an immoral and unnatural sin. and marriage is a religious thing Even though homosexuality MIGHT be a sin, it's not greater than any other sin. My point is, in the bible it also says having sex before marriage is a sin and lying is a sin.. how come they haven't put a law on those sins?  God loves everyone, if god really thought homosexuality was sin why did he create them? I strongly am for gay marriage</text>

         <text>look, honestly i am against gay marriage. a lot of you bring religion into this and though it may be the source of your opinion not all people are religious. it is plain and simple that men and women were made for each other.In other words gay marriage just isn't natural.  though some may say otherwise it is a choice to be gay/lesbian or not. with that said i think its rude that a lot of the pros are so discriminating. even if you are against it you don't need to be rude, even if they are doing something wrong in your opinion. if you truly do believe in the bible then you shouldn't discriminate because there are many verses in the bible that say we need to love everyone. there are many examples like in Matthew chapter 5, i believe, it says to love your enemies.</text>

         <text>marriage is a religious construct mandated by God.  Civil unions offer the same benefits as marriage.  The Bible is very clear that homosexuals, adulterers, idol worshipers (money and power in today's terms) the will drunkards, the sexually immoral, and the lascivious will not inherit the company of heaven.  When one repents and changes their ways God is unable to see their former sin through the veil of Jesus's sacrifice and blood.  It should be noted that contrite repentance is required and as well as an attempt at stopping the sin.  God does not dilineate which sin is worse, they are all equal.  God mandates marriage between a man and woman, no where is same sex marriage addressed.  It seems that the gay lobby wants merely to attack Christian and Jewish beliefs and destroy the constructs of what God mandates marriage to be.  Civil unions are the legal answer, and since most gays do not believe in the true sacrifice of Jesus and that we have a responsibility to live Godly live as free from sin as possible, even fleeing from sin as the Bible says.  I just do not understand why Gays want to attack religious unions between a man and a woman.  The Bible says to cast out those who are sexually immoral until they repent and change.</text>

         <text>why cant gays get married? why cant they be happy like everyone else in the twisted world? sure, you dont need marriage to be happy together but dont you find it wrong that straights can and they cant?  USA, country of the free. no. clearly it is not. if you are free you should not be held back because of someone elses decision. i mean, why are gays treated so differently from straights? they're human too. they have the same feelings and deserve the same happiness.</text>

         <text>I am pro because I believe, not only should heterosexual couples have the right to get married, but so should homosexual couples. this is partially a biast opinion, but it is an opinion none the less. One day, I would like to be able to marry my girlfriend. It's my right as a human being to marry whoever I want to as long as there is consent. To tell me otherwise is to take away my 14th amendment right. 'Equal protection of the law. Homosexuality is found in over 1500 species. Yet, homophobia is only found in 1. Tell me, which is the one that's not natural now?</text>
