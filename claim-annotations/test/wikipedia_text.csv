About 2\/3 of the nation hates it bitterly .
Again vaguely saying there is negative stuff on Bush 's articles and no negative stuff here is not a real complaint .
Am I to believe these subjects and points have not been summarized already ?
And it is absolutely irrelevant what is on another person 's bio .
And what is this about the Washington Times and New York Post being being considerably right of center .
"As for what is there , basically all that is missing is that he walks on water ."
... and church of `` Christ '' is not `` Christian '' ?
"Bessides , only one of the list of sources mentions UCC , all the rest of them talk at length about Christianity ."
"Bush never dropped out of a specific church though , so the comparison really is not applicable ."
He just had a dispute with Rev. Wright .
"However , Obama never abandoned his religion or said he changed it ."
I agree the term `` Christianity '' is too broad .
Bush 's handling of Hurricane Katrina made some people hate him .
Can you justify the large amount of criticism mentioned in the GWB article ?
"Effectively , he is saying criticism of Bush is legit but not for Obama ."
Either there is no real criticism of Obama or their was a biased party who preferred Obama over Bush .
I do not think they should be held to different standards .
"If there are criticisms , they should be only the main ones ."
It is yet another issue that Obama has inherited from other people\/agencies .
It should not be a game anyway .
Obama 's handling of the spill may be questioned in the future .
Opinion columns are not reliable sources .
A more thorough explanation would be appropriate perhaps at Presidency of Barack Obama .
"Actually , The Christian Science Monitor is a reliable source , in almost all areas ."
All of these are far less significant than the oil spill .
All other details are superfluous .--
Although there is surely room to be critical of the Obama administration for various reactions .
"And they are based on public perception , not legal conclusions or proven facts ."
As I mentioned we 'll likely have to keep trimming things back periodically to keep it focused .

How do Wiki editors think this matter should be handled ?

I remember reading in history books that Warren G. Harding was our first black President .
maybe it should say that Obama is the first `` openly-Black '' president ?
Or maybe people should stop obsessing over Obama 's race and leave it as it is ?--

"Guys , let us talk about this ?"
"I have no prob with the paragraph itself , just not where it was ."
"I just do not know where to put that info , even if I recognize it is important ."
I nominate the paragraph on the Veleia inscriptions for deletion .
I really think we should take out that paragraph .
It is irrelevant for the classification of the language .
"Also on the topic of homosexuality , this is the official , from the Catechism stance of the Church ."
"Also the sex abuse scandal , widely condemed by Catholic and secular thought . ''"
And why are we still using the non-Catholic word `` pro-life '' ( consistent life ethic may work better ) .
As far as I know the term is a concise encapsulation of the Church 's stance on these issues .
"But , really ... have you read WP : LEAD yet ?"
But I will still say it is a clear violation of WP guidelines .
"Controversies , if any , must be mentioned ."
"Controversies go in , as per WP : LEAD ."
Does that still fit in the lead ?
Especially when the Church stance is clearly outlined to respect and accept them .
"Always best to do that , I think ."
"And the issue is NOT just in the U.S. : andAs it stands now , the Roman Catholic Church article is not neutral ."
Australia had already jailed 51 priest before the U.S. scandal even broke !
Certainly my impression is that it is not limited to the US .
Encarta devotes another 5 % of space to issues of the Catholic Church in the U.S. and another 5 % to issues in Canada .
Even the Encyclopedia Britannica devotes a thousand words to the topic .
"For example , it has membership problems because of it : see BBC News ` Poll finds Irish mistrust Church ' ."
"For example , this book : I throw up my hands here ."
I am doing my best to get reliable figures .
I do not think it is helpful in clobbering U.S. Catholics and say that all the deviant priests are American .
It is from the Insurance Journal of June 2007 .
It is much longer and omits the steps taken by the church to prevent future abuse .
she told industry newspaper Education Week in a March 10 interview .
That compares with about five decades of cases of abusive priests .
The church has since instituted reforms to prevent future abuse .
The Protestant churches in the U.S. report 260 cases per year .
The U.S. Department of Education estimates that teachers abuse up to 10 percent of school children .
The whole paragraph contains all notable facts already .
These are key facts about the scandal that are notable and provide a comprehensive understanding .
These facts were referenced and need to be replaced .
And we need to make this specific to the inquisition we are talking about .
"Deleting it all is not nice , but it does make the section too long , and most of the quotes are very `` preachy '' ."
Far better to do as the sources do and say what percentage of convicted or tried people were actually killed .
"However , once again , the problem with going into this much detail would probably further unbalance the article ."
I am going to change the propaganda sentence because I still think it is misleading .
"I did not quibble about the original quotation , since more qualification would only have made the article longer ."
"I disagree with the change also , I left a note on Xandars page ."
I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact .
"I have done my revision of the Inquisition section now , with citations to Kamen 's book , The Spanish Inquisition ."
I invite you to consider changes that will reflect what your research reveals in the preceeding two paragraphs .
My sources are Catholic Church approved third party published sources .
My two sources are valid as defended above .
Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur means that the book is declared to be free of doctrinal and moral error by the church .
None of what is cited by McBrien contradicts Church teaching on Faith or morals as any real catholic would know .
On matters of belief why not go to the direct source ?
Or do you now want to slander a priest the way you attempted to slander me in the personal attacks you attempted ?--
"Please do not get combative , it was your sources that were time and again brought under scrutiny in both FACs ."
"Reading my comments above , I do not think I have slandered you or this priest ."
Show me where it says in Wikipedia that all sources are required to have a Nihil Obstat and an Imprimatur .
The childrens books were used for 8 citations of basic fact like Martin Luthers 95 theses and others .
We do not need Wikistress building .
`` Inside Europe : Will the Polish Catholic Church regret keeping quiet about paedophile priests ? ''
2) Do we mention it in the body ?
Could be a new source for the RC sex abuse article .
Depends what you mean by ` recent . '
"Deutsche Welle , the German International broadcaster , had this short documentary this morning ."
"For a 2000 year old institution , the Protestant Reformation is recent ."
"http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3205993,00.html ."
"I belongs in the article , but not in the lead because it is a leading characteristic of the Catholic church .--"
I did not have to ` trawl ' the internet to get the above story .
"Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations ."
Several editors agree that there is an NPOV issue with this article .
That is the whole purpose of tags : to flag articles so that fresh input can be obtained .
The NPOV tag has not been justified .
The NPOV tag is justified until that happens and the inclusion criteria is understood and accepted by all .
"The title is fine , and the criteria are set out in the article ."
This is a discussion that has already recently been had .
This is already a `` pro-fringe '' compromise .
"This seems to show that if you give pro-fringe editors an inch , then they are simply encourage to take more ."
"While some of the entries on this list are definitive pseudosciences , some of the entries are not ."
Then you cite something else as a criteria .
Therefore I am absolutely convinced that itching is a good reason to perform diagnosis .
"Well , here 's why you should ."
Why should I address your concerns when you clearly will not address mine citing `` ad hominems '' at me ?
You are being picky for the sake of it .
Your argument is not with me but with a Wikipedia content guideline and a number of editors who feel the same way .
As I understand those topics are best contributed to Wikinews .
Best to find a source discussing this before adding it .
Comedy central did the audio bleeping .
